0,AI Tool Accelerates Skin Cancer Detection in Veterans,,,"recognized skin diseases, malignant or benign ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AI Tool Accelerates Skin Cancer Detection in Veterans Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the U.S. with one in five Americans developing it in their lifetime. This risk can be even higher for service members and veterans – studies have shown they are often exposed to chemicals and high levels of ultraviolet radiation which can increase the risk of developing skin cancer. This makes the early screening and treatment even more critical to improve health outcomes. Working together with the Department of Veterans Affairs, GDIT developed an accessible tool that will quickly identify if a lesion may be cancerous. It uses deep learning artificial intelligence (AI) to classify images of skin lesions into seven common categories, determine if an image is indicative of a common skin disease, and recommend immediate follow-up care."

2,Cancer Research Empowered by the Cloud and Machine Learning,,,"HEALTH Cancer Research Empowered by the Cloud and Machine Learning Finding novel ways to treat and eradicate cancer, the second leading cause of death in the United States, continues to be the core focus for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Cancer Institute (NCI). In 2016, NCI issued a challenge to the global cancer research community to accelerate efforts to eradicate cancer.  In response, cancer researchers recommended that NCI establish a central data ecosystem to provide a repository for cancer data that would allow sharing of data generated by research for all cancer types. NCI’s Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC) was born of that request and was created as a place for data discovery, patient participation, and disease surveillance in the interest of rapidly developing novel treatments and therapies. CRDC’s petabytes of data and billions upon billions of individual data points includes everything from genomics, proteomics, imaging, and cancer models to clinical trials, cohort studies and patient demographics. Its volume of data, number of users and contributing investigators are growing all the time. Today, CRDC empowers researchers with state-of-the-art visualization, analysis, and interoperability tools in a flexible, cloud-based computational environment. GDIT works with NCI’s CRDC to provide a flexible cloud environment enabling indexing of massive data sets and large-scale processing for applications such as artificial intelligence and machine learning."

The consequence of this added visibility to the topic is that new and important conversations are taking place across the federal government, within agencies and within organizations, like GDIT, that partner with them to deliver on some of our nation’s most critical missions. At GDIT, these conversations are changing how we work and how we think about our work. It involves addressing injustice wherever it is and, in some cases, taking a hard look at the internal processes and procedures that may be unintentionally contributing to that injustice. For our part, it means asking how the mission we’re supporting benefits people? Who are they? And who are we overlooking? How do we improve equity and promote justice?  That way of thinking impacts everything from design to decision-making and is sparking a new breed of innovation. “ Addressing environmental justice internally and with our clients and having conversations that are changing how we work and how we think about our work ” Sherry Witt Sherry Witt Science Engineer Program Manager"

Last year we expanded in our footprint there with a new home in the city’s  Cortex Innovation Community  (CIC), making a significant investment and continuing our commitment to the region. More recently, part of that commitment has also involved driving innovation and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) talent development locally. One way we do that is by working with partners like  STEM Board  and the  Little Bit Foundation  to send GDIT speakers into area schools to talk about the plethora of careers and the opportunities in the field, building capacity and a diverse talent pool ready and able to make an impact. Corey Carter, a GDIT program manager based in Springfield, Virginia, has spent the last several months visiting classrooms – virtually and in-person – in St. Louis to talk about his work and about his atypical and inspiring career path in STEM. “Many of the schools I visit don’t even have formal STEM programs,” he said. “These schools are under-resourced, serving underprivileged kids, and many of these kids have never seen an engineer who looks like them. When I go in and talk to the students, we start with what STEM is, how technology plays a role in their everyday lives, and how to get involved in doing STEM work.” Corey often points to an iPhone as relatable example of technology and how students interact with the people powering those devices. He talks with them about the people who answer Help Desks, or who code applications for the phone, or who run the network infrastructure that enables everything a person does on a device. “ Once we get students excited about technology, then we tackle the next challenge, which is helping them understand the paths they can take and what’s possible with a career in STEM ”"

Our scale, breadth and depth of experience, modernization capabilities and a secure environment enables us to deliver GCS enhancements and evolutions that are long overdue.

At the same time, the explosion of mobile devices and capabilities evolved travelers’ expectations about what their experience should look and feel like when crossing borders. Even before the pandemic, things like mobile biometrics and contactless engagement were the goal. All of this together drove a need for modernization of the systems in place to ensure a safe and secure experience for travelers. The pandemic only accelerated it.

But we know that having great technology in the hands of students is critical to preparing them to join a 21st century workforce built on ones and zeros. GDIT is partnering with schools in St. Louis, home to the company’s  new geospatial innovation center , to bring innovative, hands-on science, technology, engineering, and math learning opportunities, known as STEM, to classrooms. Created in partnership with STEMBoard , the project-based kits help introduce students to basic coding skills with self-paced activities that teach the fundamentals of coding to students in a fun and accessible way. These fun coding lessons, called  LINGO Lessons , help students learn through experience: “In the Driver’s Seat,” teaches students how to build a driverless automobile’s back-up sensor; “Music through Movement,” teaches students to interact with sensors and build instruments that “play” with a wave of a hand; and “Reaction Time,” teaches students how to build a reactive, two-player game that tests speed by combining sports, electronics, and hand-eye coordination. GDIT and STEMBoard provided the LINGO lessons to support the STEM-capacity building work GDIT was already doing with non-affluent, on-the-rise schools in the St. Louis area. GDIT is also working with STEMBoard to create a geospatial-intelligence-specific “GEO LINGO” lesson for high school students, helping students visualize and map data, which will be in schools during the next academic year. To ensure the program’s success, GDIT and STEMBoard worked with teachers to develop the curriculum and training. As the pandemic required certain aspects of the program to be conducted virtually, GDIT and STEMBoard leveraged a blended learning model for introducing and walking students through their LINGO lessons while building institutional capacity by helping teachers learn to present these new tools. During the fall semester, GDIT engineers and other employees visited classrooms to provide experiences that students could connect with. Many of the students had never met an engineer at all, much less one who is also a minority, who looks like them. The resources GDIT and STEMBoard brought into the schools are ones the schools might not otherwise have had access to. Meeting real people who have done the work, can talk about it and want to give back makes it much more real and much easier for the students to see themselves in a STEM career. “GDIT is increasingly concerned about the widening gap among students who are prepared to join a digital workforce and those who"

In those early days of cloud computing, Kindervag understood that traditional security models – which assumed that everything inside an organization’s network should be trusted – were outdated. “Never trust, always verify” became the zero-trust mantra. It’s important to note that zero trust is not a solution or a collection of products; it’s a cyber strategy and model.

Modernization in a DoD context involves leveraging new technical capabilities, achieving enhanced operations, and functioning more efficiently as an agency. Strategies aimed at achieving these goals are directed from the center and include policy, standards, and guidance, yet they are executed in a distributed fashion across agencies and subagencies. As each service branch builds its own incremental components, an unintentional result is the creation of siloed implementations. We’re seeing it today across everything from  cloud  to  cyber  and  zero trust . Dan Schaaf, GDIT’s Senior Solutions Director and Army Sector CTO recently  made the case  for establishing an interoperable, zero trust foundation for JADC2, the Joint All-Domain Command and Control initiative, which involves connecting all sensors from across all branches of the military into a single network.

It’s a question that makes you think about where we are in our cloud journey. AWS has been around for some time and Azure has too. Most agencies have dipped their toes into cloud in some capacity, and we’re now reaching a point where many agencies are embracing multi- cloud models. That, in and of itself, has created some confusion about how to prioritize cloud initiatives and even how we should think about cloud. To put it in simple terms, I’d like to highlight three things you need to consider for a multi-cloud strategy: an understanding of  why  you’re moving to the cloud, governance, and an approach to leverage the tools that exist today to protect against building silos.

As a high school dropout, I had no direction and no plan for future success. My sister persuaded me to join the military. Serving in the Army in Europe was a wonderful experience. The Army taught me self-respect, self-discipline, integrity, and initiative to succeed. I saw parts of the world that I had only dreamed of growing up. While serving in the military, I completed my GED and took some college prep courses. Upon my Honorable Discharge, I went to college on the G.I. Bill and received my bachelor’s degree, and later in life I worked hard for a master’s degree in Business. The Army turned my life around. I am convinced that it was my military experience that saved my life and provided me a path to a happy and fulfilled future. I received an Army Commendation Medal just prior to my Honorable Discharge. The education the military provided, along with the life lessons of self-respect, determination and drive to succeed all took root during those years in the Military. I have continued to grow and learn throughout my adult life. All of these attributes can be traced back to my experiences and mentors from the Army."" U.S. Air Force Fernando L. Perez Fernando L.

Yet  new research  shows that 96 percent of DoD IT decision makers are experiencing delays in their enterprise cloud migrations – and 68 percent say those delays are obstructing their department’s ability to meet its mission. Clearly, finding ways to accelerate cloud adoption is of the utmost importance – both for these leaders and their departments as well as for national security. This is precisely why GDIT recently convened key stakeholders from the technology industry and from government for the third and final part of our annual  Emerge  event series. The day-long event focused on the ways mission partners can rapidly and efficiently move to modern IT platforms and on the new technologies that are not just meeting the mission but advancing it on the battlefield and beyond. As one might imagine, there was ample discussion around critical enterprise clouds such as Defense Enterprise Office Solution (DEOS), milCloud  2.0 as well as the tools and technologies that are fueling the next generation of the cloud solutions – things like artificial intelligence, edge computing, advancements in cybersecurity and beyond. It was a pleasure to hear from the leaders who are implementing emerging technologies on the ground and on the battlefield and to hear about their plans for the future. Danielle Metz Danielle Metz , the Department of Defense’s Deputy Chief Information Officer for Information Enterprise, talked about DEOS as part of one of the  “most exciting and significant modernization efforts to date”  at the DoD. She noted that the department is rethinking its business processes and working to better communicate and collaborate and looking at ways technology can enable teams to transform data into actionable information necessary to execute on the mission. She stressed that DoD  “has the vision and blueprint needed to bridge the vast divide between the current environment and where we want to be.” Caroline Bean Caroline Bean , DISA Program Director of DEOS, talked about the cloud as an enterprise collaboration tool, noting that the pandemic forced DISA teams to work in new ways that would not traditionally have been supported in previous environments. The ability to work from anywhere  “set the bar for how the DoD wanted to operate on a day-to-day basis going forward,”  she said. ®"

Chris shares, “We meet with those employees and talk about what they need and then connect with their managers and leaders. We have discussions around what they can do and what we can do as an organization to help support them. We found such great success not just with the individual who’s going through that in their life, but with the whole community they’re a part of in the workplace.” Not everyone’s transition is the same so it’s a tailored support plan for each individual. Chris engages with the individual, their leaders, and the wider organization to make sure they have what they need to feel supported. “We’ve had really great feedback and have seen employees who have come out of these processes with stronger relationships, not just with their managers, but their peers as well.”"

This session focused on how GDIT is building a native, on- demand VMware environment within milCloud  2.0 that is designed to accelerate cloud migrations for mission partners. Joining us for the discussion were: Bill Rowan, Vice President of Federal Sales for VMware’s U.S. Public Sector organization Mansour Yusuf, Chief Cloud Architect for Dell Federal Systems Brian Whitenight, Partner Accounts Director for milCloud  2.0 at GDIT This new integration will allow mission partners to leverage their existing VMware footprint in milCloud  2.0. This will compliantly empower digital workspaces, modernize data centers, integrate clouds, transform security, and more. This easier, faster migration also comes with the security you need from milCloud  2.0, with multiple security measures built in via the IL-5 approved environment and through Dell’s supply chain. As MeriTalk noted in a post-event article, it will “facilitate cloud extensions like virtual desktops, disaster recovery functions that complement continuity of operations plans, migrations that can be application-specific or data center wide, and the build-out of next generation applications.” We’re excited about this new integration and how it will continue to enable milCloud  2.0 to effectively and efficiently support the warfighter in today’s constantly changing environment.

In most cases, a person is assigned a username, role and access rights that govern their interactions with the organization or agency. This controls what they can and cannot do within a network, application or website. But what should bots look like when they are operating on your network? Interestingly, a bot should not be treated differently: it must be monitored and logged just as if it were a person operating on the network. Having the right understanding, approach and architecture for implementing bots smartly into operations is just as important as setting up proper security controls governing personnel access.

Emerge  is designed to showcase real technology solutions, the impact they are making today, and what that impact will look like in the future. Emerge part-two focused specifically on  Emerging Technologies  and how innovation is addressing long-standing technology challenges in an exciting and accelerated fashion. The day’s  agenda  was packed with panel discussions on how these advances are changing the world of government and what’s on the horizon for agencies as they navigate this change. The event also created an opportunity for a dozen GDIT technology partners to showcase their solutions and the ways GDIT has leveraged them in support of a number of mission-critical programs. Here are five key highlights from the day: 1.  Choice is Powerful and Important Choice is Powerful and Important : GDIT’s partner ecosystem is broad and deep. More than a dozen partners joined the event to demonstrate their capabilities and talk about why they’re important to agencies in an ever-evolving technology landscape. As we have seen working with customers across the federal government, when choices are plentiful potential is infinite. GDIT partners participating in this event included representatives from:  UiPath ,  Dataiku  and  Nvidia  (Artificial Intelligence); CloudBolt ,  Cloudera  and  Snowflake  (Cloud);  GitLab ,  Hashi Corp and Sysdig  (DevSecOps); and  Wickr ,  Tanium  and  Virsec  (Cyber). 2.  Building Cyber Resilience is Key: Building Cyber Resilience is Key:  From agency databases, to retailers, to gas pipelines – we’re all aware of the havoc a cyberattack can wreak. But cybersecurity is about more than preventing or responding to attacks; it’s about building cyber resilience that enables organizations to defend against attacks and evolve their cybersecurity postures faster than ever by using cutting-edge technology to do it. André Mendes , Chief Information Officer at the Department of Commerce, and  Tim Persons , Chief Scientist, Science, Technology Assessment, and Analytics at the Government Accountability Office talked shared first-hand accounts of how they are preparing federal systems to keep pace with evolving risks and complex technology environments. Mendes talked about how the Department of Commerce’s mission is broad and diverse. As examples, he talked about how the Census Bureau securely completed the decennial almost entirely in cloud-based environments with half a million endpoints. He mentioned the Patent and Trademark’s work to leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to accelerate patent reviews, facilitating innovation and intellectual property development in the United States.

One of three tracks in the April event was Automate Everywhere, with a focus on automating where and when it makes sense for the mission, driving efficiency, efficacy, and innovation on programs across the federal government. The first session, titled  The Future is Now: Predictive Analytics with AI and ML  focused on how agencies are reaping the benefits of using artificial intelligence and machine learning to elevate service support and user experiences today and for the future. The discussion was moderated by GDIT Senior Director, Data & Analytics  Dave Vennergrund Dave Vennergrund , who was joined by our Federal Civilian Program Director,  Karen Painter Karen Painter , and  Raymond Wedgeworth Raymond Wedgeworth , the Director of Data Analytics and Systems Group, with the Center for Program Integrity, at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services During the discussion, Wedgeworth noted, “It’s not just about the analytics and algorithms that are created, but how we present that information back to the investigative community, so they know how to work a case.  So, we are very careful in turning our models into something that is useful to the investigator by developing a series of characteristics and attributes that can trigger these models.” Exciting stuff. Another highlight of the track was the session titled,  The Bot Revolution: Driving Performance with Robotic Process Automation (RPA) . This discussion zeroed in on how RPA is becoming a mainstay within agencies and how they can use it to do everything from improving user management, to ITSM process automation, and cyber response in order to reduce costs and accelerate IT deployment, organizational change, and mission success. The panel was moderated by GDIT’s Emerging Technology Director Tim Gilday Tim Gilday . Joining him were  Kenneth Newton Kenneth Newton , Director of Service Delivery at the NASA Shared Services Center and  Geert Geert Rensen Rensen , Founder and Director of Business Development at Be Informed. Speaking about intelligent automation, Newton said, “It’s a great tool to use to become a better organization and to free up your personnel to do more higher-value, cognitive work, leaving lower-value work to the bots.” The final panel in the Automate Everywhere track was  DevSecOps: Scaling is Non-Negotiable . This breakout discussion examined the difference between platform and application DevOps, the prerequisites for enablement, the organizational challenges associated with DevSecOps rollouts and more. The discussion was moderated by  Jay Olsen Jay Olsen , Solutions Director at GDIT, who was joined by  Michael Ducy Michael Ducy , Transformation Specialist at Red Hat;  Ed Farler Ed Farler , Senior Director, Solutions Architect at GDIT; and Dennis Gibbs Dennis Gibbs , Senior Director, Software Development at GDIT."

How to leverage that data for better decision making and better question-asking can be the difference between good organizations and great ones; between staying ahead of competitors or not; between winning a major contract or losing out. The journey toward building and remaining a data-driven organization can be daunting and can leave many wondering where exactly to begin. While there is no textbook answer to this question, GDIT’s experience tackling this challenge with our customers has given us a unique insight into methodologies that enable successful data analytics implementations. From this work, we’ve identified five critical considerations for organizations looking to become truly data driven. 1. Start with the Mission It all starts with the mission.  What is the mission of your organization? What do you do? How? And why does that matter for customers and the business? By zeroing in on this question you will be better able to understand which data you should prioritize collecting and assessing in order to aid you in answering – and asking – transformational questions of the business. 2. Look for Mission Impediments Anything that stands in the way of you achieving your mission and objectives as an organization is killing you – operationally, financially, fundamentally. By better understanding what is keeping you from accomplishing your objectives you will be better able to establish mechanisms for collecting and analyzing data that helps determine if your actions are helping or hindering this process. Success doesn’t have to be complicated.  You can start small and build on each success. 3. Promote Transparency This is all about the importance of being honest about the data you find, even when it isn’t pretty. Becoming data-driven involves exposing data to a wider audience, even to your customers.  Transparency is extremely powerful – because it helps identify where your issues are and where you need to focus your energy.  Good data doesn’t lie, but change lies in first being transparent."

In this session,  now available to watch on-demand , we took a deeper dive into the latest technologies within milCloud  2.0, discussing the native, on-demand VMware environment and how it is helping mission partners accelerate their cloud migrations at record speeds. During the webinar, GDIT’s partner director of milCloud  2.0 Brian Whitenight talked about how the VMware integration meets three key value tenets: security, ease of use, and affordability. While cloud services have been tough for DoD to take advantage of due to concerns about security, the requirement to refactor workloads and reference architectures, and the perils of acquisition processes, Whitenight said “the integration of VMware into milCloud  2.0 brings all of those pieces together, making them much easier to overcome.” Whitenight went on to detail how, on the security front, the milCloud  2.0 infrastructure operates within the DoD Information Network (DoDIN) physical facilities and network boundaries. It’s also FedRAMP High Impact Level 5 certified. He went on to note that milCloud  2.0 is pre-competed and pre-approved – meaning a mission partner can use a credit card to procure cloud service in as little as 48 hours. Pretty incredible. The session also covered the underlying benefits of this new offering and its application connections; tactical use cases and product demonstrations; as well as the latest technology features that mission partner are using to meet their mission-critical needs.

It’s an interesting – and important – question. The answer is an absolute, yes. Here’s why: The principles of the IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) and Scaled Agile Framework  (SAFe) are aligned. They’re both designed to make enterprise IT operations run more efficiently and effectively. They are value-driven approaches that have immense benefits for organizations’ missions and users. Bringing them together for customers doesn’t happen as often as it should, but it is something we’ve done a lot at GDIT. And in doing that work, we’ve gained perspective about how to combine the two platforms in ways that work for everyone. At its core, combining ITIL and SAFe is all about supporting organizations as they make informed decisions. It’s about feeding that process with information that can open up their appetite for change. ITIL helps facilitate considered decision-making, while Agile presents a model for fast feedback loops that can accelerate and decentralize the decision-making process. Of course, in practice, there are some challenges associated with asking ITIL to run at the speed of SAFe. 1. Technologies mitigate risk First, you need technologies that mitigate risk and allow for change. Often, within IT teams, mitigating risk equals inertia; but you can accomplish risk mitigation with technologies that deliver robotic process automation, machine learning, or AI, for example, that can present an appropriate risk analysis to elevate stakeholders’ awareness of impact, making them comfortable and ready to move forward with change. While SAFe promises you speed of delivery, ITIL gives you stability in your environments, with both practices incorporating security throughout the life cycle. Technology enables the two practices to work together harmoniously; real-time determination of risk associated with a change can be nothing short of transformative. 2. Culture that embraces change Second, you need a culture that helps people embrace change. Let’s be honest, sometimes people can be afraid to stick out their necks and advocate for change because if things go wrong, they’ll take the heat. ®"

And for good reason. These are the systems that help the agency and its operating divisions perform cutting-edge research, develop vaccines, conduct clinical trials and more. Amid the global COVID-19 pandemic, this work carries with it more importance and urgency than ever. A key part of the agency’s modernization effort involves looking across its technology portfolio and infrastructure, from regulatory systems to ones that support critical public health initiatives. HHS – and more broadly of the entire country – depend on these systems performing as they should. Consequently, every resource spent on optimizing and modernizing these systems results in an increased ability for the agency to fulfill its mission at this critical juncture in time. Appian Low-Code Automation reduces risk The GDIT team, with legacy knowledge of the agency and its operating divisions, recently leveraged our  partner ecosystem  to bring forward a new and innovative collaboration with leading low-code automation provider,  Appian . Together, we are able to accelerate and simplify the agency’s modernization efforts while also reducing risk. Low-code automation brings a faster, simpler and more user-friendly approach to the agency’s modernization efforts. For starters, it reduces the amount of traditional hand-coding necessary. This not only accelerates the development and delivery of applications, but it also reduces risk. It minimizes human error and enforces coding standards to ensure quality development. An agile development approach is also supported through low-code automation, which involves business users earlier in the development process. Taken together, these things all dramatically simplify modernization and digital transformation efforts. And when things are simple, fast and less risky, the capacity to take on more projects only grows. Alliance brings innovation to customers and GDIT Across HHS, GDIT has several Appian engagements underway to modernize various applications, create efficiencies and drive"

But there’s a larger reason for adjusting course. Agencies are also reaching an inflection point, at which it’s become critical for federal officials focus more fully on their hybrid cloud journey. Those who’ve already made the leap to the cloud have learned, perhaps the hard way, that each of the major cloud service providers has its own unique strengths and operating requirements. But to fully leverage the power and capabilities of the cloud, it’s crucial that agencies and their components take a step back to make sure they truly understand their data strategies first — and then determine which cloud is best suited to their needs, and why. It’s equally importantly that agencies understand what they’re going to be doing in the cloud once they get there — and, longer term, how they plan to integrate the outcomes back into their operations. If you don’t make those decisions properly up front, chances are, your data may very well end up in the wrong cloud. As the global CIO at GDIT — a company that has a long history of working with government agencies — I’ve experienced those lessons first hand as we went through our own cloud journey. And I’ve come to appreciate they’re particularly important for federal agencies. Today, GDIT uses a combination of cloud service providers as well as our own, significantly consolidated, on-prem data centers to meet our infrastructure and platform needs. There are several reasons we opted to work with multiple cloud providers. One basic reason was to prevent vendor lock-in. But more importantly, it also was to make sure we were able to manage our data in the most appropriate environments. And of course, having the right level of security has always been a monumental concern with our agency customers. So is how our thousands of employees and engineers interact with agencies and that data every day. That journey began by developing a playbook to systematically review our data requirements and determine which cloud services were best-suited to our, and our customers’ needs, including a heavy emphasis on security assurances. We then tested direct connections to respective cloud providers and developed containers to see what worked best. Finally, we moved full speed ahead to take advantage of all that cloud has to offer, including AI and ML, automation, scalability and greater analytic capabilities."

She recalls how, growing up in the small town of Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, there were essentially two paths for women: going to college or becoming a farmer’s wife. Julie’s mom didn’t have the money to send her to college and Julie had no desire to become a farmer’s wife, so she joined the military, specifically, the Women’s Army Corps. This was at the end of the Vietnam War era when there were only about 500 women in the Army in total. Among the other 60-women in her unit, Julie found her stride and charted her own path. She served for 22 years at posts in Texas, Germany and Washington, D.C., eventually rising to the rank of E8 Master Sergeant (MSG) and making significant contributions at every turn. “I worked at the Army Burn Unit on a research team which led to a patent for the Silvadene Burn Cream which is still in use today,” she said. “I also ran a blood bank in Germany for a neonatal unit that was responsible supplying fresh blood for these tiny one or two-pound babies being born there.” Julie was also running the blood bank in Germany during the Ramstein air show disaster in 1988, which at the time was the deadliest air show accident in history. It was a mass casualty event with 70 fatalities and hundreds of serious injuries, surely a day Julie will never forget. GDIT is fortunate to have had Julie among our ranks for more than 20 years. Following her service, Julie says joining GDIT was a natural choice. She loves her country and wants to continue supporting the military mission, which she does every day on the Military Health Life Sciences program. This initiative is focused on helping to research, educate, diagnose, and treat the healthcare issues affecting our service members, veterans, and their families. “When I was on active duty, we focused on esprit de corps (a feeling of pride, fellowship and common loyalty shared by the members of a particular group) and in my GDIT organization, we really promote camaraderie and the notion of success for all – no lone rangers. We’re like a family or even a unit,” she shared. Like many who join the military young, Julie had some doubts about joining the civilian workforce upon retirement. “When I went to retire, I doubted my skills, but the military absolutely did prepare me for this job,” she said. “The mission does change but the military taught me time management, people skills and it instilled in me the love of country and the urge to protect our country.”"

Together, the group talked about all that 2020 taught us (hello, overnight transition to teleworking) and looked ahead at how collaboration, paired with the latest technology, can propel IT modernization going forward. Asked about what the future might look like, the panelists nearly all pointed to data and managing data workflows and being able to leverage data to advance missions and spur innovation. Brigadier General Raduege said, in his view, the future is going to be about mobility and accessing data and securing it. He noted that users of all kinds have an appetite to access more and more data, faster and faster. As we go mobile, he said, our attack surface is getting bigger and broader. As a result, he and his team spend a lot of time looking at security and what the future state needs to be, examining things like ZeroTrust architectures, as an example. “Data is the fuel which powers innovation, which is the mechanism we will use to drive all the advances that we’re looking forward to,” said Greer. “It’s the new weapons system that allows our warfighters to be more adept and agile and bring new capabilities to theaters that benefit them.” He went on to note that we absolutely need diverse voices in the collection and use of data. Doing that will allow the data to fuel innovation even more effectively, he said, because we’ll be bringing a diversity of thought into how we look at and analyze data. Kinnard, with the Department of Labor, agreed. She noted that agencies can sometimes be data rich, but information poor. In an ideal state you’d have different agencies with different priorities able to access data and make decisions, she said. “Our number one priority is supporting workers,” she said. “We need to assure them that we have the data infrastructure to"

Cybersecurity in the government cloud  was just one recent conversation between Melina Scotto, GDIT’s Federal Health Chief Information Security Officer, and Ravi Raghava, Chief Cloud Strategist for GDIT's Federal Civilian Division. Security is a paramount concern for every government organization seeking to migrate their data or infrastructure into the cloud. Whether you’re looking to move to the cloud or you’re already there, the five best practices they shared for securing the cloud are a must. 1. Assess security controls FedRAMP is an authorization process through which the U.S. federal government provides a seal of approval to cloud service providers who comply with a stringent set of cloud security best practices. The program was first rolled out in a December 2011 memorandum from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). All federal executive offices, departments, and agencies must use a FedRAMP-compliant vendor when storing federal data in the cloud. System owner and hybrid controls should be well-documented and tested. In order to work with a cloud service provider, federal agencies must implement the cloud service provider’s (CSP) security plan and receive authorization to operate in the CSP’s environment. Achieving this  ATO (Authority to Operate)  may take between several months to a year, depending on the complexity of the environment and the FIPS-199 level of the data. 2. Encryption at rest Cloud data must be encrypted both in transit (moving between the customer and the cloud) and at rest (in persistent storage) and in use (compute). Encryption at rest safeguards your sensitive data stored on the cloud, protecting you in the event of a data breach. System owners and engineers must configure the encryption to meet federal requirements for FIPS-199 Moderate and High data. Storage as a service offerings from public cloud providers such as Azure, AWS, and Google all include the capability to encrypt your data at rest. Enabling encryption at rest is as simple as checking a box to turn it on. Depending on the provider, the cost of"

You want to modernize your agency by moving to the  cloud  and deliver mission solutions faster while driving savings and improving security. With so many approaches and providers available, where do you start? A key consideration before you even begin your strategy and planning is your cloud economics:how and why you are going to spend your allotted funding? And what are the potential barriers that can slow down the migration project? Once you're clear on these two elements, you'll be better prepared to address the challenge of following fairly rigid government processes to obtain what are often very fluid cloud computing assets. 'Economics' means more than 'money' As a federal agency leader, your economic decisions encompass both financial considerations as well as the value received in exchange for your investment. You recognize that low-cost doesn't always mean economical if its value fails to achieve your agency’s primary mission. High cost doesn't always mean expensive if it provides better value and a higher return for your investment. All of these considerations are significant as you contemplate how your agency will adopt the Cloud Smart strategy. You need to establish a project budget that covers all the necessary aspects of cloud, but if you've never procured cloud services before, you may not know what all of those aspects are, nor how to estimate their cost. And you'll need to justify your project budget by providing a high-quality return, so capturing and accounting for all costs is imperative to the project's success. You don't want to just spend your money; you want to maximize your economic investment. Barriers that threaten cloud adoption economics Two federal agency realities pose unique problems to maximizing your investment: government procurement processes and culture. Each must be considered and accounted for as part of the overall project to meet both the budget and the project's timelines."

Cloud promises better performance, better availability and security that’s almost always better than what legacy solutions could deliver. At least, isn’t that what everyone is telling you? The reality is that cloud is a broad term that applies to a range of products and services. Each cloud solution is really only as secure as the choices you make to implement them. Even more important: today, cloud is never a single solution. We live in a hybrid, multi-cloud world, where users move in and out of different cloud services all day long. For chief information security officers and their teams, the network perimeter now includes applications and services running on mulit-tenant clouds hosted by commercial providers, in government-only shared-cloud and agency-run data centers. Hybrid environments add complexity as well as flexibility. They create more choices for information architects – and more seams that attackers will try to exploit. Here, experience matters. You don’t hire a novice climber to lead your expedition to a Himalayan peak, and the same applies as you try to mount a successful cloud security strategy. Just as critical is ensuring your architecture can withstand the tremors and quakes that will inevitably come your way. Your architecture has to work regardless of circumstances – it must scale to meet changing demands over time. That new enterprise data collection tool sounds great at the start, but six months in, it’s cost-prohibitive to store all the data it generates, and the payoff is unclear. That’s another place where experience can help inform better decisions. Today’s proliferation of cyber tools can be as much of a hindrance as a help. Better security does not necessarily mean more tools. It means making efficient and effective use of the best tools available. At GDIT, we’ve built a cloud-focused security stack from market-leading components to meet the Secure Cloud Computing Architecture (SCCA) requirements set by the Defense"

To be successful, you’ve also got to be reliable, resilient and secure. Securing engineering software to be secure—especially in the cloud—is one of the biggest challenges facing government agencies. It’s not that success is so elusive, but rather that modern methods pose particular challenges to the government’s conventional ways of doing business. Agile processes and delivery—i.e., iterative improvements using a series of continuous, rapid releases—is now widely recognized as a better way to develop software. Agility allows for evolving requirements and unanticipated changes, rather than forcing government customers to lock down all possible requirements ahead of time. The lesson from Netflix, though, is that agility only takes you so far. In the cloud, systems must also be resilient in the face of outages and surprise service interruptions. Netflix executives realized that if their systems weren’t engineered for resilience from Day 1, it was just a matter of time before disaster struck. The problem was finding a way to test for resilience. Today’s consumers take using the cloud and streaming video for granted. But just a few years ago, when Netflix was transitioning from its own physical infrastructure to the cloud, company leaders worried that users would flee the service if streaming video proved unreliable. They needed a way to ensure the system was resilient enough that users could still access their content, even if portions of the cloud infrastructure failed. The solution: “chaos engineering.” By randomly shutting down parts of the infrastructure, Netflix engineers found they could discover weaknesses and engineer solutions before disaster struck. “Since no single component can guarantee 100% uptime (and even the most expensive hardware eventually fails), we have to design a cloud architecture where individual components can fail without affecting the availability of the entire system,” the company wrote on its  blog  in 2011. “In effect, we have to be stronger than our weakest link.” Today, using chaos engineering to ensure system resilience is widely practiced by the likes of Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft, among many others. But why stop there? Why not apply chaos engineering to security, as well? Aaron Rinehart, chief enterprise security architect at United Health Group, raised this issue recently in a  post  on OpenSource.com, writing that “Security Chaos Testing has shifted our thinking about the"

It sounds crazy to say, but traditional networking, as we often think about it, is largely a thing of the past. Cloud computing, remote working, multi-device management – they all require us to approach networking entirely differently. What used to be about two computers “talking” to each other, is now about facilitating constant, real-time information sharing – on a massive scale, across devices that are rarely (if ever) in the same building. Enter Software-Defined Networking, or SDN, which together with innovations in networking infrastructure is enabling modern, efficient, reliable workplaces (and workforces), as well as just every facet of our online lives these days. In the simplest terms, SDN provisions, monitors and manages networks. Though it can instantiate networking functions in software on commonly available hardware, it is no substitute for good network design. Together, good network design and SDN can give network engineers practically unlimited creative freedom in developing new networking functions or innovations. Below are four benefits of moving to SDN for your organization to consider. 1. Greater Reliability via Automation SDN is a great option for large, complex networks that require lots of up-time. It gives engineers the ability to re-route networks on the fly. For example, when an outage occurs, a software defined network can be configured to automatically reroute around that area and maintain the connections your users need. 2. More Efficient Network Management SDN offers real-time visibility into your network performance. This visibility gives you the ability to optimize your network’s performance and to drive its efficiency (as well as that of your team’s)."

That’s why we’ve added this topic to our cloud series—we couldn’t miss an opportunity to talk about a technology capable of generating incredible benefits for agencies by helping them increase automation and drastically improve their operations. So, let’s discuss AI and look at why the government is so interested in it today. Doing more with less AI encompasses a broad set of capabilities that—in some manner—emulate human intelligence. Examples include facial recognition, speech recognition, robotics, language translation, and machine learning. If a machine is performing a function that used to require a human, you might call it AI. And all of the AI capabilities that I just listed are being used today in the federal government to help specific missions. Today, AI tools are being used across organizations to automate many tasks, from automating call centers and help desks, to identifying risks, to preventing cyber attacks, to predicting network/system maintenance. Cyber analytics and machine learning models built with deep learning neural networks are being used to identify fraudulent transactions, assess risk for travelers, verify biometric identity, adjudicate benefits claims, manage disease, assess genomic expression data, screen airport luggage, and more. AI even helps us build applications and analyze data more rapidly. Ultimately, AI is automating repetitive decision-making and large-scale pattern recognition at scales, speeds, and accuracies unachievable by humans. But most of that would not be happening so rapidly without the cloud. What AI owes to the cloud"

To win, we must study our opponents to discover their weaknesses. So when the global hacker community gathers for DEF CON – the massive annual hacker conference – General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT) is right there with them. DEF CON isn’t all cloak and dagger. It’s an eclectic mix of professionals and amateurs who see every lock and firewall and security feature as a puzzle to be solved or a door to be opened. Technical briefings, exhibits and live competitions offer a chance to learn more about the way hackers can exploit vulnerabilities, which we use at GDIT to develop strategies to help secure our customers and mitigate risk and exposure. Think of it as a massive opportunity to gather intelligence and insight. In our evermore connected world, those insights are increasingly valuable. Hackers aren’t just focused on the latest new devices – the plethora of lightbulbs, thermostats and mobile devices that may hook into our network. They’re also digging into aging technologies we may be overlooking or taking for granted. Like the fax machine. Most offices still have a fax, often an underused or forgotten feature of an all-in-one printer/copier/scanner. It’s almost always allows for network access. And it may be a major security liability. Hackers can exploit fax software by delivering malware disguised as an incoming color fax.  When the incoming image file is opened, the malware installs itself, gaining access to everything else on the network besides. That wasn’t as much a concern when faxes were hooked up to stand-alone phone lines, but now that they’re tightly integrated"

This includes employees like  Julie McGrath Julie McGrath , Vice President of GDIT’s Military Health Life Sciences program, who spent more than 22 years in the U.S. Army. She’s spent almost as long – 21 years – at GDIT. She says joining GDIT was a natural choice; she loves her country and wanted to continue supporting the military mission after retiring from the service. “When I was on active duty, we focused on esprit de corps (a feeling of pride, fellowship and common loyalty shared by the members of a particular group) and in my GDIT organization, we really promote camaraderie and the notion of success for all – no lone rangers. We’re like a family or even a unit,” she said. Sean Kelley Sean Kelley  recently joined GDIT as the new Vice President for the Veterans Affairs Business Area. He served 20 years in the U.S. Navy: 10 of those as an enlisted deck seaman then hospital corpsman, and the other 10 as a Naval officer, Health Care Administrator and IT executive. His most significant accomplishment in service was responding as the CIO of the U.S. Naval Ship Comfort in response to the earthquake in Haiti in 2010. Sean notes teamwork as the one thing he learned in the service that helps him the most today. “Take care of the team, and the rest will follow,” he said. “The team makes things happen, not the leader.” Julie, Sean and more than 300 other veterans are members of an Employee Resources Group (ERG) at GDIT called Honor. All month long, the group will be highlighting the many contributions of veterans within GDIT. This will include a Veterans Day address by our CEO Amy Gilliland, a panel discussion on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), targeted virtual chats, and opportunities for GDIT veterans or family members to share their stories with the rest of the company. In November and all year long, our Human Resources team will continue to  actively recruit and train veterans  looking to transition to post-military careers. GDIT is uniquely positioned to help America’s veterans build on their experience to help deliver a better tomorrow – both for themselves and their families and for the agencies they support. Finally, Veterans at GDIT are also actively serving other veterans, like our team in Bossier City, Louisiana that is supporting the Department of  Veterans Affairs (VA) Enterprise Service Desk Program . The team  recently hosted  VA Assistant Secretary for Information and Technology and Chief Information Officer James P. Gfrerer, and was commended for its work in support of IT modernization efforts at the VA that support America’s veterans."

In the piece below, Dr. McFadden cites the imbalance between the demand for cybersecurity solutions and the number of cyber professionals (even as the field grows) as one reason for that growth. Automation tools, which themselves still require oversight, allow cyber defenders to focus on high-priority items while the tools focus on things like enhanced perimeter protection, improved endpoint and continuous monitoring, automated patch management, and more, contributing to enriched cyber situational awareness overall. Read more of what Dr. McFadden had to say below. Attack Surface, Workforce Trends Building Demand for Cyber Automation Tech A confluence of trends – including ever-mounting cyber attacks, expanding network attack surfaces stemming from increased teleworking during the coronavirus pandemic, and an enduring shortage of skilled cybersecurity workforce talent – is creating demand for more autonomous cybersecurity technologies. The good news for Federal government IT is the parallel between the need for more automation in cybersecurity and the efforts in developing machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. Those are the foundational technologies integral to making machines shoulder more of the basic workload in cyber defense, while freeing up human capital to do the more advanced labor. A Problem of Numbers There’s nothing new about the need for cybersecurity; for as long as IT networks have provided services, they have been under attack by adversaries seeing disruption and monetary gains. But as networks – and attackers – have become more sophisticated,"

Look to the Cloud By  Dave Vennergrund Dave Vennergrund Vice President, AI and Data Insights September 24th, 2018 In today’s knowledge economy, data is the raw material and data scientists are the talented artisans who can spin that data into gold. The only problem is that data scientists are in very short supply. For government agencies, that talent shortage is limiting their ability to develop and deploy advanced analytical solutions. While we would all like to snap our fingers and solve this problem, the fact is demand for data scientists will likely continue to outstrip supply for years to come. Fortunately, automation is coming to the rescue. We can’t automate all of the high-level work data scientists do. But we don’t have to. Through automation, we can streamline the process of building models, saving time, and shifting workloads down the chain, both to data analysts and, where appropriate, to machines. The convergence of modern cloud architectures, open source software and advanced analytics tools is allowing data analysts to perform work that only veteran data scientists could do a short while ago. And that’s having payoffs in terms of what we can accomplish using advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning tools. Amazon’s new SageMaker is one such platform. SageMaker provides developers and data scientists the ability to quickly and easily build, train and deploy machine learning models – at scale and in the cloud – in a fully managed and governed framework. SageMaker greatly simplifies the process by providing building blocks that can be used to accelerate the entire process. What might take weeks to accomplish using conventional data science practices can now be accomplished in a matter of days. At General Dynamics Information Technology, we’ve been pioneering artificial intelligence, machine learning, data mining tools and natural language processing for more than 20 years, across the federal space. Our Data and Analytics Consulting practice identifies, evaluates and helps our programs insert new technology, like emerging self-service and assisted data science platforms such as Amazon’s SageMaker. We’ve built and deployed numerous solutions in defense, intelligence and civilian agencies, creating predictive analytics tools to perform image recognition, identify cyber threats, forecast budgets and spending, cluster genomic and health data and stop fraud, waste and abuse.

GDIT is commemorating this milestone throughout the month of July. This story celebrates our commitment to supplier and contractor diversity. When the GDIT Contracts & Acquisition Management Organization (CAMO) team needed contract labor to assist with contract closeouts, data cleansing and contract novation, CAMO Vice President Darryl Scott knew just where to turn. Darryl had worked alongside contract employees from the  National Industries for the Blind  (NIB) since the early 1990s and he was eager to do so again. The NIB is the nation’s largest employment resource for people who are blind. In its more than 80 years in existence, it has created employment opportunities for the visually impaired in nearly every sector of the American economy. NIB and its network of associated agencies employ nearly 6,000 blind men and women, including military veterans, across more than 250 locations nationwide. Together, NIB and its partners produce thousands of products and deliver a variety of professional services for the federal government and U.S. military every year. It’s no surprise that they’re on GDIT’s subcontractor list, and when Darryl found them there, he quickly worked to bring NIB team members onto his project. “Partnering with NIB is a classic case of doing well by doing good,” he said. And that may be an understatement. NIB team members, including those from its partner,  VisionCorps , quickly got to work on the CAMO project. In a few short weeks they’d closed more than 1,500 contracts, undertaken a data cleansing effort impacting more than 1,300 active contracts in our Salesforce database, and are supporting CAMO’s efforts to novate more than 1,300 active contracts and more than 200 inactive ones. They team has been so effective that they’ve been asked to continue to provide the contract labor for these projects through the end of 2020. CAMO’s Senior Director, Janetta Brewer, is beyond thrilled with the team’s performance. She says, “The NIB/VisionCorps team has been the epitome of resilience since the start of the contract. The COVID-19 pandemic prevented the work from being performed onsite as originally intended so we had to transition to a remote work setup. The team demonstrated a great deal of patience as we worked to ship IT equipment to them, grant the appropriate network/systems access, meet their assistive technology needs and provide them with online training. They work well with our CAMO team members and have provided work of the highest quality.” “…innovations can only happen when we come together. Our inclusivity is a core part of the results we bring, not just to our clients, but to the world.” – GDIT Mission Statement"

Hosts Leadership in STEM Discussion, Moderated by GDIT CTO Ben Gianni At GDIT we believe diversity drives innovation, so when our Black Employee Network (B.E.N.) Employee Resource Group (ERG) convened a discussion on black employees’ experiences building STEM careers, it provided a tangible moment in time for us to examine where we can do even more to ensure that we are creating opportunities for everyone to build and grow meaningful careers with us. The discussion, moderated by our CTO  Ben Gianni Ben Gianni , was an important one touching on mentorship, career journeys, workforce mobility, cultivating diverse STEM talent, and ensuring diverse employees can move into leadership roles. Joining the conversation were B.E.N. members  LaLisha Hurt LaLisha Hurt , our Deputy Chief Information Security Officer;  Ash Torres Ash Torres , a Cyber Threat Analyst; and  Eric Toliver Eric Toliver , a Program Technology Manager on our Cyber team. Each of these individuals has built a career in STEM via vastly different avenues. They shared their experiences with the group, along with practical advice for those beginning their careers, as well as those in positions to influence policy, hiring and recruiting. Torres, who began her career in Human Resources and transitioned into a role on our cyber team, credited two things for her ability to make that move: researching and networking. She told the group about her quest to learn all she could about the job she wanted and the certifications she would need, so that she had the confidence to present herself as a viable – albeit non- traditional – candidate, given her HR background. She also told the group about how she was a relentless networker. She sent emails to GDIT colleagues in the field introducing herself and asking questions. She attended events, asked people for advice, and then followed it. She noted,  “Maybe I was persistent, but I was remembered because of it.” “Maybe I was persistent, but I was remembered because of it.” Hurt, who commended Torres on her approach, pointed out that – in cybersecurity especially – professionals are in-demand but there’s not enough talent. She recalled how a neighbor of hers wanted to enter the field. She had 20 years of experience managing people and programs. She was an excellent researcher and loved to learn. But when she looked at job postings for even entry level positions she got discouraged – there were walls of acronyms and required certifications. So, Hurt sat down with her and inventoried her skills and helped her map them to be applicable in the cyber arena. She encouraged the group to be creative and, following Torres’ lead, confident about asking for the roles they want."

General Dynamics IT (GDIT) is proud to be a trusted partner for the United States military, helping the Department of Defense (DoD), Strategic Commands and the different branches of the Armed Forces to integrate the technologies capable of helping them overcome some of their largest challenges. A pursuit that is only made possible by the company’s commitment and dedication to hiring veterans and retired members of the military. Veterans are the foundation of GDIT’s workforce – forming a strong core of dedicated, passionate and knowledgeable employees who have been forever changed and enriched by their previous experience as part of the United Stated military. In honor of Veterans Day, we reached out to some of the many veterans who make GDIT’s workforce one of the most capable in the world to hear their stories and learn about their experience in service to our nation. Here is what they told us: Sam Adams – U.S. Air Force Sam Adams – U.S. Air Force In 1981, after talking with my father over coffee at the kitchen table, I enlisted in the U.S. Air Force. He was currently serving as an Aircraft Loadmaster in the U.S. Air Force Reserve at Carswell Air Force Base. My own service came via the U.S. Air Force as part of an Air Support Operations Center. Courtesy of our government, I was trained in basic and advanced electronics to maintain and repair the radios used by forward air controllers (FACs) to call in air strikes for ground troops. This meant training missions at Fort Hood, near Killeen, Texas, a U.S. Army base to this day on the periphery of my activities as GDIT employs workers there."

This year, of course, the global coronavirus pandemic reshaped the intern experience altogether. Facing challenges is not new for GDIT, so we adapted our traditional intern program and went virtual. As part of larger internship program, we identified 24 high-potential interns, dubbed “The Avengers,” to participate in a workshop program that allowed them to work externally and internally across the business, and alongside GDIT team members who were also working remotely. The Avengers Workshop program was led by Todd Isaacs, Director of Innovation, in our Intelligence and Homeland Security Division. Interns were paired with mentors and selected to work on either internal GDIT or customer supporting projects. The interns working on external projects, about two-thirds of the group, were deployed across various contracts at GDIT. The internal-focused interns worked on developing prototypes of “contract-adjacent” innovations that could deliver low-cost, mission-focused solutions to customers. These internal projects included: Demonstrating the fusion of robotic process automation (RPA) and visualization technologies to collect and present a business intelligence dashboard Building an application using Amazon Web Services (AWS) and biometrics technology to combat external and insider threats Automating the generation of a compliance matrix for discrepancies between documents The entire Avengers group also completed online trainings and watched demos of critical software development or project management tools like UIPath, Tableau, Alteryx and Microsoft Teams, to name a few. At the completion of their internships, the Avengers also participated in an Innovation Expo ""Open House"" to showcase their work and to talk about their experience at GDIT.

Lessons from today’s largest AWS ecosystems reveal the core elements of advanced cloud brokerage from orchestrated governance to layered security. GDIT brings the real-world experience, operating more than 30 cloud brokerage programs on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and managing more than 50,000 cloud instances across a wide variety of government agencies. What lessons can organizations of every size take from one of the largest AWS implementations to use within their own environments? When a customer asks for our first-hand view of working with the government to provide AWS at scale, we often begin with our four key tenets of cloud brokerage: Governance, Brokerage, Automation and Security. Enterprises that address these critical areas position themselves to realize the cost savings, agility and other benefits the AWS cloud can offer. Whether you’re focusing on the business side (e.g., cost control) or on the technical side (e.g., identity and access management), you can use these ideas to create a seamless cloud strategy that works for the enterprise as a whole, no matter the scope and make-up of your cloud infrastructure. The goal is to make things as simple as possible for your users while reducing risks and ensuring the right security to prevent data leakage. Governance Governance When it comes to the first tenet, Governance, it’s important to ensure compliance that includes the implementation of policy- based enforcement and control of cloud resources, providing set workflows and checkpoints for service orders. Another essential is a cloud cost optimization tool for invoicing and billing, cost allocation, right sizing and best practices to help maximize the business value of cloud and efficiently allocate resources. That’s not always easy when you have thousands of discrete AWS billing statements and need to untangle orders and internal chargebacks. With so many statements, the use of a standardized tagging taxonomy simplifies the task. Additionally, incorporating transparency into your service level agreements (SLAs) across multi-clouds is critical, providing one unified view, potentially by integrating your legacy SLA tools with new cloud assets. Brokerage Brokerage In terms of Brokerage, we again want to keep things simple for the customer. We do that by implementing provisioning services to manage resources across multiple environments and keep track of user actions. Cloud services are managed through an intuitive"

The event was sponsored by major tech players Dell, Hewlett Packard, Microsoft, Splunk and attended by women IT professionals from all over the DC Metro area. The day was dedicated to the empowerment of women at all levels of their IT careers by providing actionable tools, knowledge and networking skills. Kristie Grinnell, GDIT’s VP of IT and Supply Chain and Global CIO shared in her opening remarks that only 29% of the IT workforce is currently filled by women when women make up 50% of the total workforce – that needs to change. She said the purpose of EmpowHER is to demonstrate IT is a great field for women to pursue and to spotlight some of the women already there. “We make sure to show the increase in representation of women in this field, so girls growing up are seeing themselves in these new roles that are being created each and every day in areas like artificial intelligence, robotics processing automation....” Attendees heard from accomplished women in IT, many of whom never thought they would end up there. No woman’s path was the same, but their stories had many overlapping lessons. The event was more than an afternoon of speaker sessions. It was a set of powerful themes for us to take back to our work and personal lives. Tribe The first theme and maybe the most popular throughout the day other than IT was  tribe . Melinda Garvey, founder of AW Media and the keynote speaker, said the fastest way for women to succeed is to find and build a tribe. A tribe is a close group of friends and colleagues who advise each other on career moves and challenges each are facing in their professional and personal lives. When asked by the audience what her number one tip is for handling self-doubt, Melinda said she turns to her  tribe . “There is nothing better than having people who will encourage you and will pick you up off the floor, because this is really hard, and it’s always hard. You get a lot of no’s whenever you’re starting anything…my tribe is critically important.” The act of building a tribe was proactively encouraged as attendees were challenged to connect with five new people via LinkedIn throughout the course of the event."

Titled, milCloud  2.0 Quick Start: Overcoming Obstacles, Maximizing Opportunities, the session covered the research findings as well as an overview of milCloud  2.0’s core technology capabilities, its use cases and benefits, and tips on how to navigate the funding process. Here are four key learnings, gleaned from the 175 DoD mission partners surveyed: 86% believe milCloud  2.0 will have a positive impact on DoD missions (with improved infrastructure management and cost reduction cited as top benefits). 38% are in the early stages of adoption, either planning for it or currently in the midst of a migration. 38% already have funding for milCloud  2.0 adoption but nearly as many, 34% are unsure about the status of funding. 25% say adoption within their organizations has been too slow and, again, roughly as many, 29%, are unsure about the pace of adoption. As was discussed during the webinar, research revealed that there is uncertainty around milCloud  2.0 adoption – even as its benefits are beginning to become even more understood. Respondents cited greater education and training and improved access to technical resources as the key drivers necessary to push adoption forward. This is where GDIT wants to help.

And if you continue climbing the ladder, the numbers get worse; only 17 percent of Fortune 500 Chief Information Officer (CIO) positions were held by women in 2017. Those numbers, provided by the National Institute for Women and Information Technology, expose the unfortunate reality that women are not entering the IT field and, when they do, they are not advancing up the ranks of IT departments at the same rate as men. Janice Haith of Oracle, Rachelle Putnam of General Dynamics Land Systems and Kristie Grinnell of General Dynamics IT discuss the challenges they overcame as they progressed through their careers at the Women + Technology Summit. To explore this issue further, and to empower women who want to explore careers in the IT field, General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT) and HPE collaborated to sponsor the Women + Technology Summit, a one day event designed to give women the actionable tools, knowledge and networking skills needed to grow their IT careers. The Women + Technology Summit was championed by Kristie Grinnell, the Vice President of Supply Chain and Chief Information Officer at GDIT. Grinnell was joined by a number of high ranking female executives from her company, HPE, Oracle and other partners. The event also featured keynote presentations from Teresa Carlson, the Vice President of Worldwide Public Sector at Amazon Web Services and Deborah James, the 23rd Secretary of the United States Air Force. During the Summit, the speakers highlighted the number of opportunities that exist in the IT field across the United States. Speakers encouraged attendees to keep an open mind when approaching IT careers, since not all positions involve coding and software development. They encouraged attendees to explore the opportunities that lie outside of coding – such as project management or marketing IT solutions and products – should they be uninterested in doing such jobs as software development. When it came to advancing within the IT field, one of the common themes across many of the panel discussions and"

Responding to cyber threats or vulnerabilities in real-time is no longer the aspiration, thanks to artificial intelligence and machine learning. But how do agencies use these advances to their advantage, how can they make their cyber initiatives as effective as possible, and what should they know before they begin? For many, Autonomous Cyber is the answer. GDIT’s Cyber Director, Dr. Matt McFadden, recently spoke with Meritalk about Autonomous Cyber, why it’s more important than ever and how the COVID-19 pandemic (and the massive shift to remote working) is affecting agencies’ need to secure their informational assets across multiple platforms and devices. His enlightening Q&A follows below. MeriTalk: MeriTalk:  With so many people teleworking now, organizations have a broader attack surface due to increased use of mobility and cloud solutions. What are some of the top challenges agencies face in this environment? Dr. McFadden: Dr. McFadden:  The main challenge with the increase in telework is that most agencies’ infrastructure wasn’t designed to meet the demand of an almost 100 percent remote user workforce. For some of our customers, we’ve had to work hard to scale their architecture, which could be anything from leveraging the cloud to supplementing the network devices that they have. For example, we had an agency customer that couldn’t provide remote access to their workers and gave us five days to implement a virtual private network (VPN) portal to support thousands of mobile users who couldn’t work from home without it – which we successfully completed. MeriTalk: MeriTalk:  Now that we are a few months into the COVID-19 pandemic, are you still seeing agencies having issues with supporting telework or is it mostly resolved? Dr. McFadden: Dr. McFadden:  I definitely think things have smoothed out a bit since COVID-19 first began affecting the workforce. Agencies are now working on more long-term strategies around the mobile workforce, and how they can scale and provide capabilities to support it over time, even when we all go back to the office. MeriTalk: MeriTalk:  Are there any other challenges that you are seeing, aside from scalability? Dr. McFadden: Dr. McFadden:  There is always the threat aspect you need to look out for in remote environments. Most agency cyber defenders are focused on those big existing perimeters that they’re used to supporting. As they go deeper into this mobile realm, they’re"

It’s also the 30th anniversary of the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). With these landmark anniversaries in mind, we spoke to one GDIT employee, Tracy Allison, about what disability awareness means, why it matters and how it comes to life for her every day. Deaf since she was 18 months old, Tracy says she’s seen a shift in how people view those with special needs. In the early days of her career, she dealt with managers who didn’t understand how to include her in team-building exercises, for example, or who were unwilling to advocate for her so that she could receive the relay services and accommodations she needed. She says she felt isolated and left out. Today, she is a Subcontracts Administrator in our Federal Civilian Subcontracts department. She makes regular use of her video phone, a sign language interpreter, and closed captions. Recently, when a training session lacked closed captioning, she worked with her managers to fix the issue. “It shows they care – I love that they take my needs and perspective into account,” Tracy shared. Of her managers,  Carmela Carmela Roberts Roberts  and director  Andrew Hinkle Andrew Hinkle , Tracy says they’ve prioritized her needs well. They make sure she has enough time to engage an interpreter for meetings and are always asking what they can do better. Like many people, she works from her Virginia home office these days due to the COVID-19 pandemic. She actually finds it to be a blessing in disguise: she feels as if she’s on equal footing while working from home. Skype and Zoom meetings make it easier for hearing people to communicate with deaf and hard of hearing people. Tracy and other deaf employees at GDIT have formed the  AbilityFirst Employee Resource Group (ERG) . Tracy says she has started to speak up more at these meetings, telling us, “Initially, I held back because I’m self-conscious about my grammar but I’m starting to feel more comfortable, especially after we had a meeting focused on deaf and hard of hearing employees,” Tracy stated. She wants people – at GDIT and outside it – to know: “Anyone of us, deaf or not, can communicate. We may need more patience – the key, in fact, is to be patient because we want to work with you and talk with you.” That’s great advice we can all take to heart. Thanks, Tracy."

What he meant was that training, done well and with intensity, was the best preparation for success in battle. Within the Defense community, Distributed Mission Operations is a specific type of training that brings different branches of the military together to rehearse critical and complex exercises. Participants are a blend of live, distant and virtual. This realistic approach models in- theater scenarios and allows participants to train at both the tactical and operational levels. It has proven to be very effective, and it’s central to advancing the Department of Defense’s enduring mission of providing combat-ready forces to deter war and protect the security of our nation. As such, DMO activities require coordination, communication and a reliable support infrastructure to make them possible. For the last five years, GDIT has supported the Distributed Mission Operations Center (DMOC), housed at the 705th Combat Training Squadron at the Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, New Mexico. We are the Air Force’s chosen industry partner, supporting their mission to maintain, operate, develop, and integrate technologies that enable DMO trainings. Under the DMOC Infrastructure, Development, & Engineering (IDE) contract, GDIT manages the DMOC Battlespace and Development Space, which includes networks, software applications, and integrated hardware. We deliver infrastructure, development, and engineering support, network operations, infrastructure, and software development. This work involves more than 73 systems, 700 computers, 16 networks, and approximately 50 servers joined together to produce a high-fidelity joint and coalition warfighter training environment. We also handle all necessary management functions, personnel, materials, components, supplies, maintenance, and documentation required to accomplish the full complement of IDE tasks.
