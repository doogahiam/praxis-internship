AI Tool Accelerates Skin Cancer Detection in Veterans,"The GDIT skin lesion classifier tool was developed during an AI tech sprint challenge organized by the Department of Veterans Affairs. It uses deep learning artificial intelligence to classify images of skin lesions into seven common categories, determine if an image is indicative of a common skin disease, and recommend immediate follow-up care. The tool is being used in initial trials of a soft-testing phase, followed by approval to conduct clinical trials at the VA’s Ann Arbor hospital.","The classifiers were trained on a library of 30,000 publicly available skin lesion images, labeled with seven skin diseases: melanocytic nevi (benign), melanoma (malignant), benign keratosis-like lesions (benign) basal cell carcinoma (malignant), actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinoma (malignant), vascular lesions (benign) and dermatofibroma (benign).Read more: Department of Veterans Affairs soft-testing AI tool to speed skin cancer diagnosis How an AI-powered tool could help diagnose skin cancer in veterans    It uses deep learning artificial intelligence (AI) to classify images of skin lesions into seven common categories, determine if an image is indicative of a common skin disease, and recommend immediate follow-up care.","skin, image, lesion, veteran, tool, benign, cancer, ai, classifier, va","skin lesion, skin cancer, skin disease, skin lesion image, classifier tool, malignant benign artificial intelligence, skin cancer detection, veteran skin cancer, common cancer, service member",,"recognized skin diseases, malignant or benign ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AI Tool Accelerates Skin Cancer Detection in Veterans Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the U.S. with one in five Americans developing it in their lifetime. This risk can be even higher for service members and veterans – studies have shown they are often exposed to chemicals and high levels of ultraviolet radiation which can increase the risk of developing skin cancer. This makes the early screening and treatment even more critical to improve health outcomes. Working together with the Department of Veterans Affairs, GDIT developed an accessible tool that will quickly identify if a lesion may be cancerous.

Together with Dr. Trilokraj Tejasvi, associate professor at University of Michigan Health and Chief of Dermatology at the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, the tool was developed to address the challenge of identifying skin cancer early the veteran community. To do it, the team applied transfer learning techniques to deep learning models, comparing seven image classifiers built using deep learning algorithms. The classifiers were trained on a library of 30,000 publicly available skin lesion images, labeled with seven skin diseases: melanocytic nevi (benign), melanoma (malignant), benign keratosis-like lesions (benign) basal cell carcinoma (malignant), actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinoma (malignant), vascular lesions (benign) and dermatofibroma (benign). From there, the team selected the most accurate model and built a cloud-based, containerized solution that could assess the images, identify a lesion as either malignant or benign, classify the condition, and make follow-up care recommendations. In addition, the team explored approaches to help explain the decision to evaluators by outlining the features and elements of an image that impacted its classification. The skin lesion classifier tool is hosted in AWS, running in a container. It can be accessed through any web browser. A physician will be able to simply pull a skin lesion image onto a web page and receive an instant classification and recommendation regarding follow-up care. Reaching Veterans Virtually Being able to reach veterans virtually is also paramount as many do not live near a VA medical center. Tejasvi is also the director of the University of Michigan Teledermatology Service and the teledermatology physician champion for the Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 10. Even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the VA already had the largest telehealth program in the country. By mid-2020, VA telehealth visits increased by 1,000%. Dave Vennergrund, GDIT vice president for AI and Data Insights, sees how AI solutions can improve the care veterans receive. “Imagine you could have a telehealth application that a patient could use and hold, and they could take a picture with their phone. This would then go through a workflow and if it was concerning it would set up an instant appointment through some scheduling mechanism to have the patient seen,” he said. Today, a veteran with a skin lesion typically sees a Primary Care Provider (PCP) for a diagnosis. The PCP uses a camera to take an image of the lesion. The image is sent to dermatologists, centralized at 18 VISNs around the country, for review. Any issues with image quality are detected days later, and poor-quality images require the veteran to return for another image and start the whole process over again. Aside from being inconvenient and inefficient, this process may delay the start of potentially life-saving treatment. The skin lesion classifier tool is being used in initial trials of a soft testing phase led by Tejasvi and Vennergrund, followed by seeking the approval to conduct clinical trials at the VA’s Ann Arbor hospital. To improve the tool, GDIT is working to increase the volume of data processed by the AI platform to ensure it captures as many unrepresented disease types as possible, including images of different skin tones.

Arkansas: A First in Payment Reform,"Arkansas became the first state to successfully enact payment reform statewide. They shifted the state’s healthcare structure from fee-for-service to a value-based rewards system. Since its launch, more than 320 million claims have been processed. It helped Arkansas decrease the growing cost of Medicaid from 8% to nearly 2%, translating to a savings of $720M in just 3 years. It also improved the health of Arkansas’ people by reducing antibiotic use for unspecified upper-respiratory infections, perinatal C-section rates, and follow-up visits for heart-failure patients within 14 days by 12.4%.","Antibiotic use for unspecified upper-respiratory infections fell by 23.5% Increased benchmarks for gain-share-linked perinatal quality by 8% Perinatal C-section rates were reduced by 7.4% 33.6% improvement in strep tests with prescribed antibiotics 30-day outpatient care rate for heart failure decreased by 7.9% Increased follow-up visits for heart-failure patients within 14 days by 12.4% Average episode costs dropped between 2.9 and 9% for non-specific and sinusitis upper- respiratory infections, cholecystectomies, and colonoscopies And 73% of Arkansas Medicaid providers either saw overall costs improve or remain commendable “As a state system, we are now harnessing our data to give the providers more information about the care they give… we are helping the provider community come up with new systems of care and reward[ing] them for doing it well.""

With cuts looming, state and private groups came together to investigate a breakthrough solution to a very real problem. Challenge: Healing a breaking system. To lead the transformation, the Arkansas Health Care Payment Improvement Initiative (AHCPII) was born. Shifting the state’s healthcare structure from fee-for-service to a value-based rewards system: incentivizing quality care at commendable costs. And in doing so, Arkansas became the first state to successfully enact payment reform statewide. Solution: Finding big insights in big data. To meet the requirements of multiple state services and providers, GDIT developed an advanced data-analytics tool that used big data to influence better care. We created a secure, one-stop infrastructure accessible to both healthcare payers and lawmakers alike. First, we used claims data to identify episodes of care. Next, with that same data and clinical data, we calculated quality measures. And finally, we determined bundle payments for principal accountable providers. Results: Saving more than costs. Saving people. Our solution did more than provide access to a complex data in real time. It gave Arkansas’ providers and policymakers the tools they needed to effect statewide healthcare reform. Reducing costs and rewarding physicians. Since its launch, more than 320 million claims have been processed. What’s more, we helped Arkansas decrease the growing cost of Medicaid from 8% to nearly 2%, translating to a savings of $720M in just its first 3 years. But cost-savings were only one half of this success story. The other was the improved health of Arkansas’ people.

Through government and commercial-partnered collaboration, we provide resilient and reliable data that Airmen need to develop analytics-based answers to hard questions. We help prioritize requests from analysis exploitation teams (AETs) and provide the system engineers that allow AF DCGS to integrate and interface with key projects involving artificial intelligence, autonomy, and automation. Today, we are moving AF DCGS data from “dial-up to 5G” level of speed. Our focus on AF DCGS modernization, such as Open Architecture and Network Modernization, ensures GDIT is prepared to manage new improved IT capabilities to ensure current and future Airmen have decisive data for advantage in a contested and denied environment. Taken together, all of this maintains AF DCGS’s position as a major cornerstone for the Advanced Battle Management System – the Air Force’s Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) concept to connect sensors from all the military services. Supporting the Next Generation DCGS System GDIT’s decades of ISR experience in contested environments uniquely positions us to advance IT integration and transformation of the AF DCGS system with new AI, machine learning and digital engineering capabilities. This will further advance essential information sharing across multiple Department of Defense and Intelligence Community networks to support Joint operations and further accelerate sensor to shooter timelines. Additionally, the application of these technology solutions enables continually transformative results, such as the modernization of support for hundreds of classified servers, which has reduced manpower and cost.

Securely Connecting the Joint Force,"The Department of Defense is using GDIT’s ICAM solution to protect sensitive data and systems. ICAM provides advanced, enterprise-wide user authentication capabilities both in the cloud and at the edge. The solution is federated across enterprise, with a single, individual identity that can be used across the enterprise to validate the user and what resources and applications they have access to. It can also enable Joint All-Demand Command and Control (JADC2) by providing an integrated tactical network and a common data fabric that will underpin a zero trust architecture. It works hand-in-glove with zero trust principles and helps DoD customers build their zero trust foundations, and it supports advanced concepts of ABAC and RAdAC policy enforcement for users, devices, and services.","This will enable users to quickly establish ICAM capabilities that can be shipped to a base or forward operating location – pre-built and configured – giving customers immediate access to ICAM service capabilities in contested environments.Enterprise Capabilities That Extend to the Edge GDIT’s ICAM solution was built with today’s DoD environments in mind – environments that extend from the enterprise cloud to the tactical edge.Additionally, our Edge ICAM solution extends the DoD’s enterprise capability to support unique requirements with advances in cloud technology Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) and for denied, disconnected, intermittent, and limited-bandwidth (D-DIL) environments as well.","icam, solution, access, dod, user, capability, enterprise, trust, service, identity","icam solution, icam capability, user identity, edge icam solution, trust foundation, joint force icam solution, sensitive datum, data volume, complex information technology, sensitive critical information",,"CYBER Securely Connecting the Joint Force GDIT’s ICAM Solution Protecting access to sensitive data and systems is important for any organization.

In response, GDIT built a DoD-wide ICAM capability that tracks user identities across networks and ensures access is limited to only those who can verify that they need it. The GDIT solution offers advanced, enterprise-wide user authentication capabilities both in the cloud and at the edge, while also serving as one of the foundational components in a  zero trust  strategy. Confidently Authenticate in the Cloud – Today and Tomorrow The GDIT ICAM solution harmonizes data points from multiple sources to bring meaning and confidence to user identity. It builds on the existing DoD security architecture to manage traditional role-based access control (RBAC) while anticipating continued evolution in artificial intelligence and analytics to help the DoD migrate toward a risk adaptive access control (RAdAC) approach. The solution is enhanced with a self-service, push-button deployment experience that streamlines complexities and makes a bigger impact, faster. GDIT assembled a team of “non-traditional” business partners to help develop the solution. Each is a leader in a niche-market space. This approach allowed us to identify highly specialized partners who could quickly collaborate with us and expertly deliver the latest cloud security capabilities within our solution. Enterprise Capabilities That Extend to the Edge GDIT’s ICAM solution was built with today’s DoD environments in mind – environments that extend from the enterprise cloud to the tactical edge. Its core components include an Identity Provider (IdP), which centralizes authentication; Automated Account Provisioning (AAP), which enables automated workflows for account requests and renewals; and a Master User Account (MUR), which provides enterprise-level aggregations and audits of access rights. Together, these elements provide an ICAM solution that is both innovative and secure. Our teams are also already working on enhancing our unique enterprise ICAM capabilities. One of these enhancements is Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC), which is essentially a dynamic authorization strategy. Think of it as a series of doors, each with a lock. To get in, a user must have the key to each door and must be aligned with governance or policy before the user can “open” the door and access the data behind it. Another enhancement is Privileged Access Management (PAM) which safeguards identities with elevated or privileged access beyond standard users. With our ICAM solution, the DoD can have a single set of credentials across the enterprise, but the local services or agencies can still set access permissions and policies based on local needs. It gives them the reach-back security of the enterprise, with the flexibility of the edge. Builds the Zero Trust Foundation Importantly, the GDIT ICAM solution works hand-in-glove with zero trust principles. It helps DoD customers build their zero trust foundations, and in some cases further them, by supporting advanced concepts of ABAC and RAdAC policy enforcement for users, devices, and services. The solution is federated across enterprise, with a single, individual identity that can be used across the enterprise to validate the user and what resources and applications they have access to. Additionally, because it allows for automation and creates a federated network to break down silos, ICAM can also enable Joint All-Demand Command and Control (JADC2) by providing a single, integrated tactical network and a common data fabric that will underpin a zero trust architecture. ICAM enables that federation so customers can, with zero trust, appropriately access that fabric and support JADC2. Looking Ahead After delivering our initial ICAM solution to the DoD, we are currently expanding to support all DoD systems which serve more than 5 million users with unique identities. Additionally, our Edge ICAM solution extends the DoD’s enterprise capability to support unique requirements with advances in cloud technology Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) and for denied, disconnected, intermittent, and limited-bandwidth (D-DIL) environments as well. This will enable users to quickly establish ICAM capabilities that can be shipped to a base or forward operating location – pre-built and configured – giving customers immediate access to ICAM service capabilities in contested environments. We look forward to continuing to support the DoD’s unique security and access management needs as a critical mission partner. Bolstering the agency’s ICAM capabilities is a top DoD priority, and we stand ready to consistently raise the bar and deliver on our charge. Learn more about the GDIT ICAM solution.    "

And that means better outcomes. A key player in this new research is the Defense Health Agency’s Traumatic Brain Injury Center of Excellence (TBICoE), also known as the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center (DVBIC).  The TBICoE brings the expertise of nearly 150 neuroscientists, clinical researchers, educators and healthcare providers across a network of 14 military hospitals and two VA medical centers nationwide. Their efforts, along with the collaboration of traumatic brain injury experts at both public and private centers, are helping to cast new light on what we thought we knew about mTBI. Through a vast portfolio of research studies, multiple national presentations and the publication of numerous peer-reviewed research articles, TBICoE is constantly improving the body of science known about mTBI. One such major advancement is diffusion tensor imaging. By measuring the diffusion of water throughout the brain, doctors are able to see the white matter tracts in greater detail that electrical signals use to travel from one part of the brain to another. By comparing the brains of mTBI sufferers to control groups, we hope to develop standardized measures for determining the extent of a patient’s injuries—along with treatment courses and likely outcomes. Just like common blood tests, we now foresee one day having a panel of standard neuroimaging tests that can quickly classify brain injuries and indicate the best way to treat them. While there’s still work to be done, for many, there’s a light at the end of the tunnel. TBI research informs clinical recommendations The implications go far beyond just the military and veteran communities. From brain damage suffered by professional athletes to head injuries in youth sports, public awareness of TBI is only growing. And our ongoing research and scientific evidence translated into clinical recommendations and education products for both health care providers and patients can help shape this understanding. TBICoE is studying the effects of brain injuries on vision and hearing, as well as on cognitive rehabilitation. The data from these studies are enhancing our understanding of resilience and how to reduce the impact of these injuries. And in many cases, being added to the Federal Interagency Traumatic Brain Injury Research Repository: a national database and joint venture between the Department of Defense and National Institutes of Health that allows researchers from both the public and private sectors to build on the breakthroughs being made every day. The importance of service members being ready for any operational environment and the effects of combat on warfighters is why TBICoE’s focus will always be on service members, their caregivers and veterans. Bombs and bullets notwithstanding, even the routine firing of one’s own weapon can come with powerful concussive force, also known as low-level blast exposure. And luckily, we’re beginning to better understand how violent energy affects the brain, and how the right training and treatment can help patients improve. It’s been a long journey, but for both TBI research and its sufferers’ long-term prognoses, the future is looking bright. "

These efforts provided cost savings and efficiencies to VA as well as bringing highly skilled, cleared talent from our cost-effective regions of the United States. Surge Support to Enable Telework At the height of the COVID-19 crisis in spring 2020, average call volumes to the VA’s ESD surged by 30,000 calls per week. To manage this increase and to continue to support the mission, the GDIT VA ESD staff performed 4,800 hours of overtime in two weeks – the equivalent of 50 additional employees. The more than 500-person workforce also transitioned to 100% telework while supporting VA employees working remotely, managing all of the access, security and troubleshooting that comes along with a remote-working environment. Constantly Innovating and Excelling in Performance The VA ESD Tier 1 staff has consistently outperformed several of its service level agreements (SLAs) with a 98.7% satisfaction rate and a 99.25% Tier 1 first-call resolvable rate in 2020. It responds to over 99% of VA self-service portal issues in one business day. The team has also dramatically enhanced the customer experience, an overriding and essential objective of the program. The VA ESD utilizes  ServiceNow  to create incident records, triage, manage its knowledgebase, and troubleshoot basic issues related to end users’ desktops, user access, network access, and printing. For the VA, GDIT is constantly looking to bring innovation. We introduced robotic process automation (RPA) to further drive self- service within the VA to create additional cost savings and resource efficiency. GDIT has also provided the VA with an alternate means of network authentication, helping ensure it can self-service lockouts while still maintaining the same level of expected security. Additionally, we adopted a “shift left” methodology that progressively moves calls into the VA ESD from higher to lower tiers. The ultimate goal is to resolve most end-user questions and issues at self-service Tier 0. To do it, we use ServiceNow to collect and analyze tickets and create knowledge articles that are stored within the platform and accessible to the team. "

While there was familiarity and support for the shared services model internally, the agency had never embarked on this type of a project before. Cost savings and efficiencies delivered while servicing 80,000+ personnel Together, NASA and GDIT established the NASA Shared Services Center (NSSC) at NASA’s Stennis Space Center in Mississippi. The first service to transition was a travel function within finance, merging similar processes pursued at 10 different NASA centers into one process operated across the enterprise by the NSSC. Just three years into the contract, the NSSC already had paid for itself. Moreover, NASA’s investment returned year-over-year improvements in cost savings and efficiencies. Incredibly, NASA is the only agency across the federal government to successfully consolidate three or more major lines of business into one shared service. Today, our team of more than 500 professionals support more than 80,000 NASA engineers, contractors and university research partners. We deliver timely and accurate transaction-based support to HR, finance, procurement, IT and agency business services to NASA employees and industry partners. Artificial intelligence and emerging technology improve processes In total, GDIT and NASA have consolidated more than 60 independent services for NASA while achieving high satisfaction rates and cost savings. We’re delivering advanced technology to drive efficiency in shared services transactions, implementing intelligent automation and robotic process automation (RPA) to reduce errors, standardize processes and enable the agency to dedicate more of their time and money to mission critical tasks. Moving forward, GDIT is using the data and best practices learned from the project to further consolidate back-office operations and to identify new ways to improve processes, deliver savings and drive efficiency with emerging technologies. By helping NASA operate more efficiently, the agency can focus resources and expertise on their human spaceflight and exploration missions. “For every dollar I save on how I pay bills or process travel vouchers or buy equipment, I put that back into things like facilities management or even the mission to Mars.” Mark Glorioso Mark Glorioso Former NSSC Director  as told to Washington Technology "
Supercomputing Facility Saves Energy Costs for NASA,"NASA's new high-performance computing facility in Silicon Valley is energy-efficient and faster to deploy and cool than the industry standard. The new facility is modular, consisting of small, segmented units fitted with high performance computers, rather than a traditional data center. The energy savings and space savings may allow the agency to install new equipment in the future that could be used for scientific breakthroughs."," HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING Supercomputing Facility Saves Energy Costs for NASA At its high-performance computing facility in Silicon Valley, NASA’s Ames Research Center provides world-class processing capabilities that enable researchers to improve air transportation, study the earth’s interconnected systems and explore the moon and Mars.

To house its most powerful supercomputers, GDIT helped the agency design an innovative approach to implement one of the most energy-efficient computing facilities in the world. Challenge: Take computing performance to a higher level. The supercomputing capabilities at NASA Ames needed to be upgraded to accommodate additional equipment, but the existing building didn’t have enough power. Upgrading the current space with additional power and cooling infrastructure would had been very expensive and the replacement of legacy equipment still remained useable. High performance computers also use massive amounts of energy to cool heat-generating hardware components, driving high energy costs. Solution: The right blueprint for transformation. GDIT developed an alternate approach for cooling the HPC system, using evaporative cooling to take advantage of the local climate of Northern California. The new supercomputing facility is modular, consisting of small, segmented units fitted with high performance computers, rather than a traditional data center. Refined in GDIT’s HPC Center of Excellence, this site-specific approach increased power capacity while lowering energy costs to cool the equipment. Results: Supercomputing that’s super fast to deploy and energy efficient. Through this collaboration, NASA Ames has gained the ability to fully cool its supercomputing hardware 38 percent more efficiently than the industry standard, resulting in significant cost savings. And virtually all of the energy consumed is used for computing, instead of a significant portion being diverted for cooling. The energy savings and space savings may allow the agency to install new equipment in the future that could be used for scientific breakthroughs. sq. ft. foundation, about the size of a football field modular data centers can be supported megawatts of HPC compute equipment can be supported lower energy usage than industry average for supercomputing facilities "

LEARN MORE"," When people hear “5G” they typically think of their phones, but there’s a whole world of private 5G use cases across the federal government.

We identify the right solutions based on an understanding of the customer’s OUR CAPABILITIES OUR CAPABILITIES Learn more about GDIT’s 5G capabilities. LEARN MORE needs and their specific use case – which doesn’t always include 5G. For example, in working with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, we actually recommended they upgrade to WiFi 6, rather than 5G, because we knew that’s what would meet their specific needs. Developing Sound 5G Policies For starters, industry must work with regulatory entities to ensure a thoughtful and unified approach to policy issues that can impede progress. As an example, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) acknowledges that there must be updates to infrastructure policy to encourage investment in 5G networks and to streamline the state and local approval processes so that unnecessary delays aren’t introduced. GDIT has more than 30 years of advanced wireless expertise, to include our collaborative work with commercial vendors. As a systems integrator, we are ideally positioned to help assess, engineer, implement and operate mission-enhancing, 5G-enabled edge solutions, and to work with regulators to ensure compliance and the timely deployment of capabilities. Innovation & Standardization to Facilitate Progress Innovation and standardization, to include open platform designs rather than proprietary ones, are also essential. A large and diverse universe of  5G solutions and approaches  presents the risk of paralyzing the industry, inhibiting progress, and limiting the scalability of these solutions. Standard open platform designs enable component interoperability and seamless integration of solutions and devices. With this understanding, GDIT developed a  modular 5G capability  that can scale and adjust to meet  mission-focused edge solution requirements . We continue to leverage an open standardized platform within our 5G stack, as well as the holistic 5G-enabled edge solutions we create for customers. In doing so, GDIT ensures seamless integration with the broader enterprise and utilizes  zero trust architectures  – which address lateral threat movement within a network by leveraging security perimeters based on users and locations - to drive efficiency and security as well. Finally, we are configuring our new  5G Emerge Lab  in such a way that it leverages the latest equipment and adheres to the open platform standards. Here, we can facilitate rapid solution validation, customer demonstrations and edge solution development. Creating People-Centric 5G Solutions A third and possibly the biggest challenge, is ensuring that 5G solutions are people-centric and look at the specific use case and its requirements alongside the needs of the individual users of the solution. As an example, while the 5G applicability across a military base is very similar to the 5G enhancements to large campuses or residential communities, the users, the required security profile, and the related devices and sensors will be very different and need to be factored into the final solution design. When developing solutions around our own 5G stack, GDIT takes an outside-in approach that starts with the mission objectives and required outcomes as well as the people using the solution itself so that we can ensure we engineer optimal outcomes and, ultimately, optimal value for our customer. Without question, 5G is becoming a reality and will mature significantly over the next several months in both commercial and private applications billions of dollars are invested in this space. To fully realize the potential of 5G, collaboration from vendors – even those that compete against one another – is required.  This is why we are building a best-of-breed, multi-vendor 5G Edge coalition  to develop and deliver comprehensive solutions. The lessons we learn, the approaches we build, and the investments we make to deploy 5G capabilities will enable us to act quickly to adopt 6G – and the generations that will follow.

Unlocking the Benefits of 5G and Beyond,5G technology has the potential to be transformative for businesses and consumers as well as for the U.S. government. 5G is being used today across a variety of industries and agencies. The Department of Defense understands the need to keep pace with commercial 5G networks. Many other countries are ahead of the US when it comes to implementing 5G.

LEARN MORE recent DARPA programs. These include a new industry-university partnerships to jumpstart 6G systems, research on open radio access networks (ORAN); security and scalability for spectrum sharing and; efforts to increase resiliency and throughput for wireless tactical communications for the warfighter and DARPA’s efforts to research securely operating over MNO networks globally. As 5G technology becomes more widely available and as we look ahead to what’s next, it’s important for agencies of all types to consider both the risks and opportunities associated with 5G and other new wireless networking technologies – and the drastic changes the technology introduces at all levels of wireless architecture from network core, to edge compute, to radio, and RF spectrum. First, the Risk Spectrum is a finite resource. Like land, they’re not making more of it, and new players emerging in the space have only increased demand for it. The recent announcement that the Federal Communications Commission intends to continue to release spectrum capacity for commercial uses will put the DOD and its early-stage experimentation at the mercy of commercial mobile network operators unless the department invests heavily in next-generation wireless technology. In the meantime, it will be important for the government to adequately manage spectrum capacity for critical civilian and defense needs and work closely with industry and radio manufactures to ensure all devices meet the same standards for interference or RF filtering and shielding. Another inherent risk: Playing catch up. Many other countries – including some near peers – are farther ahead than we are when it comes to implementing commercial 5G. The window of opportunity for the U.S. defense industrial and commercial base to catch-up, or to leapfrog those nations’ advancements is rapidly closing. Now, the Opportunities 5G is being used today across a variety of industries and agencies. You’ve no doubt seen cell phone companies’ commercials touting the benefits of 5G and making claims about what it can offer. And some in some sectors agencies and companies are rolling out their own private 5G networks. These networks, however, are only the tip the of the 5G “iceberg”. 5G networks available commercially today in the U.S. are non-standalone networks basically 4.5G leveraging new radio spectrum but at the core leveraging legacy LTE equipment. Once fully 5G stand-alone compliant services are available we will see the full potential of the 5G feature set. In the federal space, 5G is being used to  support experiments at the DoD  as well as initial P5G production pilots at air, sea, and land bases across the U.S. The Department of Veteran Affairs has leveraged MNO-provided 5G to support virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) surgery training at the Palo Alto Medical Center. The Federal Bureau of Prisons has deployed private wireless at correctional facilities across the country to provide inmates with video and audio chat with those outside as well as on demand network and training access. At GDIT, we see 5G as an enabler for digital transformation and industry 4.0 – for everyone from warfighters in theater, to first responders to scientists in  remote locations using edge devices  to engineers collaborating on  digital twin simulations . In our 5G Emerge Lab we test and demonstrate 5G technologies alongside our customers. The lab is a place to convene and train skilled talent, assess emerging 5G solutions, and work with partners to innovate and rapidly develop new ones. It allows us to prototype and prove capabilities in response to customer requirements, to test and compare vendor technology, and to interact with the latest 5G technologies and then use that knowledge in support of all our customers. We look forward to continuing to conduct our research and develop 5G innovations in partnership with our customers so that we can help accelerate progress on 5G and next generation wireless across the federal government, enabling agencies to look ahead to what’s next and to expand their capacity to deliver on their missions.

Ransomware: Six Realities That Should Inform Every Agency’s Response & Resilience Strategy,"Ransomware is malware that holds systems hostage in exchange for a ransom. Cybercriminals will often use phishing emails to get in. They use worms to spread the attack to other computers on the network. A Zero Trust strategy, automated threat detection and logging software, and solid endpoint detection systems can help protect an organization from a ransomware attack. Tabletop exercises simulate what everyone in an organization will do in the event of an attack and get everyone on the same page about the potential threat, the consequences, and the appropriate response.","TAGS TAGS CYBER INTELLIGENCE  By   Matt Hayden Matt Hayden Vice President, Cyber Client Engagement, GDIT Related 51 MIN WATCH CLOUD,  CYBER,  DEFENSE,  DEE Enabling JADC2: How Digital Engineering Reduces Risk 3 MIN READ CYBER,  INTELLIGENCE,  HOMELAND SECURITY Maximizing the Defender’s Advantage: Five Steps Cyber Leaders Can Take Today 3 MIN READ CYBER Navigating the National Cyber Strategy: Five Key Takeaways for Agencies 51 MIN WATCH CLOUD,  CYBER,  DEFENSE,  AIR FORCE AND SPACE FORCE,  MPE Enabling JADC2: MPE and the Integration of Mission Enabling JADC2: MPE and the Integration of Mission Partners at the Tactical LevelRansomware attacks have impacted  research institutions , manufacturers ,  gas pipelines ,  government websites ,  school districts  and  sheriff’s offices  – and that’s just a handful of headlines from a few days.The closest things to silver bullets an agency can have are immutable backlogs (an unedited image of the data) and a  Zero Trust strategy  that quickly identify suspicious activity and restricts lateral movement across the entire network.But beyond just knowing what it is, there are things we know  about ransomware  that should inform the ways we combat it – especially within the federal government.Together, a Zero Trust strategy, automated threat detection and logging software, and solid endpoint detection systems can help ensure you locate the threat – and its worms – and aren’t left looking for a needle in a needle stack.","attack, ransomware, cyber, cybercriminal, way, strategy, system, network, trust, thing","ransomware attack, trust strategy, system hostage, tabletop exercise, min watch cloud, custom trust cybersecurity strategy, cyber ransomware, unique term, cybercriminal choosing, research institution","CYBER INTELLIGENCE  By   Matt Hayden Matt Hayden Vice President, Cyber Client Engagement, GDIT","OUR CAPABILITIES OUR CAPABILITIES Learn more about how GDIT helps our clients do exactly that, starting with building custom Zero Trust cybersecurity strategies. CYBER"," OUR CAPABILITIES OUR CAPABILITIES Learn more about how GDIT helps our clients do exactly that, starting with building custom Zero Trust cybersecurity strategies. CYBER Ransomware is one of those unique terms in cybersecurity with a name that tells you exactly what it is. It’s malware that holds systems hostage in exchange for a ransom of a cybercriminal’s choosing. Ransomware attacks have impacted  research institutions , manufacturers ,  gas pipelines ,  government websites ,  school districts  and  sheriff’s offices  – and that’s just a handful of headlines from a few days. Ransomware is also unique in the cybersecurity world because it’s one that most people, regardless of their profession, have heard about. But beyond just knowing what it is, there are things we know  about ransomware  that should inform the ways we combat it – especially within the federal government. With that in mind, here are six things we know with certainty about ransomware and six things agencies can do to better protect themselves from an attack, or to recover when they’re in the midst of one. 1. Everyone’s Going to Get Hit It sounds fatalistic to say, but it’s true. Eventually, every agency is going to get hit with a ransomware attack. The success of that attack – from the cybercriminal’s point of view – depends on how well prepared you are. The closest things to silver bullets an agency can have are immutable backlogs (an unedited image of the data) and a  Zero Trust strategy  that quickly identify suspicious activity and restricts lateral movement across the entire network. Both go a long way toward prevention of an attack and mitigating one once it’s underway. 2. Cybercriminals Will Often Use Phishing to Get In Call them a gateway drug or a gateway into your organization’s soul, targeted phishing emails are the way most ransomware attacks begin. In addition to robust employee training, like we have at GDIT, on how to recognize phishing scams, having a secure and locked- down Domain Name Services is a must. Once the attackers are on your network, again, a Zero Trust strategy can limit their movement since it requires validation and verification at every step. The attack will be like breaking into a building where every door has a second deadbolt lock. 3. They Use Worms to Move on A Network Laterally When cybercriminals have gotten into your system, they’ll use “worms” to move around. These are mini programs that replicate themselves and spread the attack to other computers on the network. This is when your ransomware attack goes from bad to worse. And when you’re in the throes of the attack, you’ll often have a “golden hour” period to shut down attack vectors. Together, a Zero Trust strategy, automated threat detection and logging software, and solid endpoint detection systems can help ensure you locate the threat – and its worms – and aren’t left looking for a needle in a needle stack. 4. Cybercriminals are Banking on You Not Being Prepared Finally, cybercriminals who deploy ransomware attacks do it because it’s easy for them. It’s even easier when you’re not prepared – and that’s what they’re counting on. Mitigations like Zero Trust, automated threat detection software, endpoint detection systems and more can help. So, too, can non-technical preparations, which we do at GDIT as well as helping clients perform them. Tabletop exercises simulate what everyone in an organization – from executives to communications directors to IT leads – will do in the event of an attack, and they’re a great way to get everyone on the same page about the potential threat, the consequences, and the appropriate response. Playbooks, often developed as an outcome of the tabletop exercise, can accelerate the speed at which you respond because you’re able to move right to execution versus developing a plan under duress. Ransomware attacks, unfortunately, happen all the time. We know so much about them because they’re so prevalent. That’s why having an appropriate response and resilience strategy – and updating it often – is crucial. 5. Ransomware Attacks Involve Extortions at Multiple Levels Ransomware attacks can cripple an organization in many ways. They can hold your systems hostage, negotiating on the basis of returning your systems to normal operation. They can hold your data hostage, threatening to sell or destroy it, or worse. They can also hold your contacts hostage and prevent you from communicating as you need to until their demands are met. Securing all of these assets in the ways discussed earlier in this piece is essential – as is bearing in mind that they’re all attractive to cybercriminals during an attack and during any subsequent negotiations. 6. Once You’ve Been Attacked, You Will Be Attacked Again It’s another fatalistic statement but, unfortunately, it’s also another true one. Once cybercriminals have found a way into your network, they’ll assume they can find another one and they will try again. After all, you’ve been behind the eight ball before; the odds you’ll be there again are good. And the criminals know it. Related, after an attack, you’ll never know if criminals are completely off of your network. Are they hiding out somewhere you didn’t look? Did they leave time bombs? Ransomware as a Service exists and is a tool that the bad guys profit from. It’s their easy button; why wouldn’t they use it? So, once you’ve been attacked, expect to be attacked again – and do something about it.

This year’s event included an intentional and important focus on partnerships given world events, the proliferation of new and ever more sophisticated OUR CAPABILITIES OUR CAPABILITIES Learn more about GDIT’s cybersecurity work. CYBER cyber threats, and the strategic direction that the Biden Administration has outlined via executive orders and other means. This year’s event was as information rich as ever. Yet four observations stood out to me. Defense is the New Offense – and Everyone’s on the Same Side of the Ball As Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Director Jen Easterly said, “Defense is the new offense.” The message was also shared via t-shirt during her remarks. And she has a point. Agencies must become more aggressive at taking out bad actors before they have an impact. Increasingly, there is recognition that doing that requires acting together and not alone. Blended operations across industry and government are necessary to secure critical infrastructure, to make our supply chain safer and to make government more resilient. Taken together, this means that not only is defense the new offense – everyone’s on the same side of the ball, and that’s refreshing to see. Mature Partnerships are Taking Root and Having an Impact Not only are partnerships between business and government taking root and maturing, so too are multilateral partnerships between nations. We heard at the event about some of the Five Eyes coordination across Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. But we also heard from cybersecurity leaders in Ukraine. While battling Russian forces, they’ve invited other nations to listen and learn about what they’re experiencing on the cybersecurity front so that those nations can defend-forward and be prepared for similar attack tactics in the future. We also heard about the progress that CISA’s Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC) is making. The JCDC was created to drive public and private sector operational partnerships to enhance collective action across the cybersecurity community – and it’s having an impact. Securing Critical Infrastructure Means Making Hacking More Expensive At this year’s event, I had the pleasure of participating in a panel discussion titled  “Securing Infrastructure in an Increasingly Connected World”  alongside Department of Energy Chief Information Officer Ann Dunkin, Dr. David Mussington, the Executive Assistant Director of the Infrastructure Security Division at CISA and a few peers from the private sector. Our discussion centered on the reality that hacking is becoming inexpensive and puts critical infrastructure and communications at greater risk than ever before. Today’s advances in hacking techniques and technology mean that cyber criminals can do what used to be achievable only by sophisticated state actors. Our job is to make it more expensive and less feasible. One way to increase costs to bad actors is to make it more difficult and to require advanced skills and tools, especially ones that can’t be acquired easily. And it’s imperative that we do this work now, because not only is the continuity of government at stake, the continuity of the entire global economy is on the line. An Embrace of Zero Trust Is More Important Than Ever Finally, what stood out to me was that embracing  zero trust  is going to be more important than ever. Ironically, in an era of partnership something called “zero trust” must be front and center. But it stands to reason. It’s a key part of the collective defense model that closes locked doors and embeds security throughout an digital environment. Securing our economy, government activity and the infrastructure that supports it all will require a full and fervent embrace of Zero Trust as soon as possible. As it does every year, the Billington Cybersecurity Summit gave cybersecurity professionals from business, government and academia alike a tremendous amount of information to ingest and act upon. It was equal parts engaging and educational and proved, yet again, that the cybersecurity landscape we operate in is an essential part of how we live, work, and build communities around the world.

Clean data is consistent, relevant, valid, recent, uniform, and complete … and rare. OUR CAPABILITIES OUR CAPABILITIES Learn more about GDIT's analytical work, including our geospatial portfolio. DATA AND ANALYTICS That’s why understanding how to curate and clean geospatial data is such an essential element of any analytical strategy. It’s also, sometimes, an overlooked one. Understanding the challenges associated with data curation and cleaning – as well as how to overcome them – is something every analyst needs to know and is the foundation upon which actionable analytical results are based. So, let’s look at five common challenges associated with geospatial data, as well as their solutions: Not Knowing What “Right” Looks Like Yes, there is a such thing as “right” and “wrong” data, and, yes, sometimes analysts begin a project not knowing the difference. This is where standards and documentation come in. A data schema that governs how data should be presented and, therefore, interpreted is so important. Make sure you have one, or that one is developed at the start of every project. Inability to Edit Data In some cases, often for security purposes, analysts will not have the proper administrative rights or required training to obtain them. In this case, and only after there’s consensus around what “right” data looks like, analysts should request that their admins provide them with the appropriate roles and permissions edit and manipulate the data. Missing Source Data or Bad Metadata Sometimes data sources are missing, or the metadata associated with it is bad or incomplete. In these instances, analysts should investigate sources and perform research to remedy this problem. Only when you have a complete picture as to where data came from can you reliably incorporate it into your analysis. Lack of Tools to Contain the Data To put it plainly, not all databases are created equal. Storing data in a way that’s secure, accessible, and easily updated is important. If you find yourself with inadequate database tools or management systems, make sure management provides the resources or workarounds. Cleaning Tools That Vary in Quality Just like databases, not all data cleaning tools are created equally either, unfortunately. Data cleaning is a cyclical process. Analysts import, merge, rebuild, standardize, normalize, deduplicate, verify, enrich, and export it… and then start again with new data imports as it becomes available. At every stage, there are tools that exist to help. Within ArcGIS, for example, there are native tools that can automate cleaning. Make sure you’re using quality tools that have an earned reputation for trust and dependability. Likewise, ensure you’re tracking the procedures for cleaning as these are often used in metadata and to investigate errors. Data curation and cleaning - clearly - are not without challenges. But starting any analytical endeavor with an awareness of these challenges and with the knowledge of how to overcome them should give any analyst the confidence and assurance they need to set themselves up for success.

LEARN MORE Together with Dr. Freddie Wills, the Vice President for STEM Initiatives and Research Partnerships at Harris-Stowe State University, and staff from the National Geospatial Agency (NGA), ESRI, and local small businesses, we developed a program of engaging and informative courses that would introduce basic geospatial concepts to a group of students and set them on a path toward fulfilling careers in this exciting domain. We had enough material to create four weeks of content for what became known as the  Harris-Stowe Summer Immersion Program . The GDIT-sponsored portion of the curriculum was a two-part course focused on how to obtain geospatial data, clean it,  fill gaps, and then analyze it. Every aspect of the course was intentionally designed to cover the basics of working with geospatial data. In the first course, students learned about databases and data curation, which involves many aspects of geospatial data management such as the collection, maintenance, preservation, and the updating of spatial data. Students also learned about the challenges sometimes associated with data curation and cleaning, among them the lack of knowledge of what “right” data looks like, the inability to edit data, missing source data (metadata), and having insufficient tools to contain the data. We walked through common solutions to these challenges, as well as how to prevent them from occurring in the first place. The second portion of the course was about scenarios, namely, about how to communicate scientific concepts related to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and geospatial analytics. In this section of the course, students learned how to present data and information via storytelling in a way that would drive understanding. To do it, the students used ArcGIS StoryMaps, a story-authoring web-based application that allows users to share maps in the context of narrative text and other multimedia content. The students also built custom web mapping applications with ESRI data in ArcGIS. The course ended with a capstone project that included a briefing to geospatial community professionals, including NGA leadership. This element of the course also included tips of developing and giving geospatial presentations, complete with presentation techniques and speaking tips. At the course’s conclusion, the students were confident in their ability to find, store, and clean data and to use it to tell compelling stories. The presentation training included in the course is sure to benefit them no matter their ultimate career choice. The skills and products they developed with the applications will serve them well for years to come. I am looking forward to next year’s class of trainees and working collaboratively with partners to iterate and evolve the content to remain aligned with this ever-changing and dynamic field.

Agencies must determine how they can detect a significant vulnerability and remediate in near-real time across an extremely large IT environment as quickly as possible. This is where autonomous cyber is a force multiplier. OUR CAPABILITIES OUR CAPABILITIES Learn more about GDIT’s cybersecurity work. CYBER Understanding Autonomous Cyber Defense At its most basic level, autonomous cyber defense leverages  artificial intelligence and machine learning  to dynamically analyze behaviors across the network, identify unusual activity that poses a risk, and automatically take action to contain threats. Implementing the right autonomous cyber defense solution allows agencies to detect unknown threats and respond in real time. Not only does this make cybersecurity measures more effective, faster, and scalable, but it also frees up cybersecurity teams to focus on advanced threat detection and mission-critical objectives rather than routine tasks or less trivial events. As agencies mature in their zero trust journeys , automation should be a key investment priority since it increases resiliency by allowing defenses to scale more effectively – preventing threats before they happen or reacting at machine speed when they do. Many agencies have realized that they need to automate to achieve a higher level of  zero trust  maturity to secure their user, devices, network, applications/workloads, and data. This further aligns to the recent cyber guidance from the cyber executive order, zero trust guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget, and the zero trust maturity models. Detecting the Unknown – Preventing Cyber Threats Every Day It might be easy to identify the threats you know about, but how do you detect the unknown with a limited time to respond and at scale? This is a perpetual challenge in cybersecurity. Enter endpoint detection and response (EDR).  Robust EDR capabilities offer IT teams visibility  into how endpoints are accessing the network and data is flowing through it at a granular level. With increased use of artificial intelligence and machine learning, this new data makes real-time continuous monitoring and analysis possible, and significantly improves our ability to identify threats within the enterprise. You can identify patterns, which makes it easier to distinguish between normal behaviors and threats. A key technology component of autonomous cyber defense  is security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR), capabilities that organizations can integrate and streamline workflows and cyber operations. SOAR capabilities allow organizations to automate playbook responses to adverse user activity across the network and can let cyber professionals visualize the digital workflow of a user. Taken together, these capabilities become a force enabler, allowing agencies to improve detection and response so cyber teams can focus on prioritized events. Furthermore, this analysis of threat activity not only detects and prevents future cyber-attacks across the network, but can also enable threat sharing of emerging tactics and risks. Addressing Government Challenges One of the biggest challenges for a government agency  is applying zero trust principles holistically throughout its environment. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency identified five pillars of the zero trust maturity model: identity, device, network, application/workload, and data. Automation and orchestration are a core overlay pillar that cuts across these different areas to ensure they are leveraged more effectively. Agencies also face the challenge of scaling solutions to meet growing needs. Government organizations typically have a set environment with a set budget and a set workforce. However, the amount and sophistication of cyber threats is constantly growing, and agencies often do not have the resources to keep pace. Fortunately, autonomous cyber defense solutions allow cybersecurity to scale and respond to incidents in real-time.  With the implementation of SOAR practices across an organization’s infrastructure, the significantly reduced time to perform routine tasks and advanced analytics can generate substantial savings that can be redeployed elsewhere. Implementing Autonomous Cyber Defense Autonomous cyber is ever-evolving, so agencies do not always know where to start on their automation journeys. Since implementing a fully autonomous system is not possible on day one, agencies need to take a strategic approach – similar to deploying zero trust. There's no one-size-fits-all approach that works for all agencies, so each agency must take the time to get it right. Knowing where to start depends on the agency’s mission and priorities.  Agencies should first assess their current status and establish a baseline of core metrics, outcomes, and use cases. Once they have a good understanding of operational requirements, the next step is determining how automation can further enable those requirements and mission success. Then, agencies need to determine how to best implement automation by identifying the core functions to automate first. For example, an agency might first consider network automation, threat detection and remediation, vulnerability and patch management, automation of application workflows, or even configuration management. In the age of real-time everything, advanced cyber intelligence is helping agencies shift toward collecting new, novel data and analysis to strengthen their cybersecurity postures. Investing in solutions such as autonomous cyber will enable faster threat detection and reaction times, scalability, improved productivity, lower costs, and a better user experience.

The environmental justice movement is deeply related and connected to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Just as DE&I conversations have resulted in more inclusivity in the workplace and a wider aperture from which to solve problems, we firmly believe environmental justice can do the same. That’s why today we are helping our clients lean into their own environmental justice conversations and, in some cases, helping them navigate new terrain. When we improve equity and break down barriers, we promote justice by ensuring our processes are fair, and that our resources are distributed fairly, allowing everyone the opportunity to thrive. This shift has been particularly encouraging to watch on projects with our U.S. Environmental Protection Agency customer. Of course, the teams there are conditioned to think about the environment and its resources, but the justice component of “environmental justice” is critically important, too. In our support to EPA’s Sustainable and Healthy Communities program, we directly engaged the community to seek input on public investments in the urban environment to promote equity in ecosystem services. Something else we know: We are stronger together when we tackle solutions of any sort, together. Environmental justice is no exception. Issues like access to resources or injustices caused by the environment deserve our attention and our action. This is why we are continuing our conversation internally at GDIT and helping customers do the same. It’s too important not to.

CLOUD premises computing, much of it in the cloud.  Gartner forecasts increased growth for the overall public cloud services market with a five- year CAGR of 21.5%, and projects that spending on public cloud services will reach $848 billion in just three years. The explosion of cloud computing within Federal agencies presents enormous opportunity for accelerated mission delivery, expanded capabilities, enhanced user experiences for end users, and greater security – a paramount concern for many agencies, from those in the defense and intelligence space to civilian agencies that handle large amounts of sensitive, PII data. “Cloud-Ready” vs. “Cloud-Native” To impart a patina of modernity on traditional technology stacks you may hear “cloud-ready” or “cloud-enabled.” This usually refers to technology built for on-premises applications and then migrated to the cloud. Often these applications were originally designed with local resources and hardware in mind. Revisions and refactoring can allow for a “cloud-ready” moniker, but the underlying architecture remains the same. Generally, “cloud- ready” software struggles to take advantage of cloud-based resources and is unable to provide the scalability and resiliency that a truly cloud-native application can bring. Cloud-ready sees the cloud as another enclave in which to operate, cloud-native was born in the cloud, molded by the cloud’s capabilities from its inception, cloud-native has never seen an on-premises installation. “ 'cloud-ready' software struggles to take advantage of cloud-based resources and is unable to provide the scalability and resiliency that a truly cloud-native application can bring.  ” Jim Fitzsimmons Jim Fitzsimmons Cyber Technology Consultant, GDIT Cyber Center of Excellence Instead,  cloud-native  applications are architected from the ground up to use cloud-based technologies. Cloud infrastructure can be extended nearly instantaneously when needed, allowing organizations the flexibility to add or reduce capacity as needed. Cloud-native applications employ microservices deployed within lightweight containers using orchestration, runtime, and networking services. Cloud- native applications leverage cloud computing frameworks and infrastructures and encourage an accelerated software development life cycle. Cloud-native applications also take full advantage of modern cloud practices such as immutable infrastructure, containers and container registries, infrastructure-as-code (IaC), and integration through APIs. The Cloud-Native Fundamentals Push Security Left Cloud-native’s fundamental principles include scalability, resiliency and frequent changes. These capabilities have brought about the emergence of DevSecOps and have pushed security left. Organizations can begin to tackle vulnerabilities and threats by building in security from the start of the development process through to production, ensuring multiple layers of security and continuous monitoring for new vulnerabilities. Cloud-native security requires focusing on: Operating Operating  in-step with other cloud-native development and architecture strategies of an organization. Ensuring Ensuring  applications are secured in a manner that is in context with how they function. Identifying Identifying  vulnerabilities and performing remediation during development. Integrating Integrating  security tooling into each phase of the software lifecycle through automated scanning in source code management systems and scanning of derived artifacts, such as container images. Security models and tools built for the days of on-premises hosting are becoming more and more of a liability. Many of the tools in use in production environments today were designed before the wide scale adoption of cloud platforms and are insufficient in providing adequate security. The speed and scale of the cloud makes it more important than ever to secure your cloud-native applications with the appropriate cloud- native security tools that can keep up with the incredibly fast-paced world of modern cloud-native applications and capabilities. And that’s exactly how it should be.

GDIT takes an intentional and thoughtful approach to providing edge capabilities in support of the new workplace reality. It starts with documenting a user’s needs and use cases.

DIGITAL MODERNIZATION"," As every home office has become “the edge” – where workers need to be productive from wherever they are on multiple devices – OUR CAPABILITIES OUR CAPABILITIES Learn more about GDIT’s edge computing capabilities, as part of our Digital Modernization portfolio. DIGITAL MODERNIZATION having an edge mindset as IT leaders is more important than ever. While all edge capabilities rely on the same foundational components, the identification of specific technologies and solutions must be tied to user needs to be successful edge initiatives that empower the workplace of the future. In the simplest terms, “edge computing” means to perform computations and to store data close to its source. Think about self-driving cars: the vehicle can make decisions (computations) based on real-time data it is gathering (and storing) about road conditions, the movement of other vehicles or unexpected objects that cross its path (right at the source). In edge computing environments, like in self-driving cars, data is being generated, acted upon, and stored all in the same place. It’s happening outside of massive enterprise architectures or data centers. The same is true for many of the intelligent devices that comprise smart cities, the connected devices in our homes or even autonomous devices used on the battlefield. Edge computing works when there is the appropriate level of connectivity and security integrated through a zero-trust architecture; when hardware and devices are managed properly; when the right applications and services are available; and when there is a stable supply chain of the required software and component parts. 5 Edge Capabilities to Support the New Workplace In spring 2020, it became imperative that government agencies and contractors in particular enabled “work from anywhere” capabilities. National security, funding for federal programs, and the continuity of government operations depended on it. At the same time, and for many years prior, rapid advancements in technologies like 5G and artificial intelligence were changing how – and how efficiently – we work. They were also changing where we do our work, and they continue to do so. These technologies and others like them are giving agencies the ability to deliver on their missions in completely new ways. GDIT takes an intentional and thoughtful approach to providing edge capabilities in support of the new workplace reality.  It starts with documenting a user’s needs and use cases, and centers on five foundational components. They are: 1 .  Security: Security:  Security must be at the forefront of any edge capability, as data will be coming in from multiple known and unknown sources and from, potentially, a multitude of devices. Our approach to security includes supply chain validation, endpoint device/sensor management, satellite, ethernet or fiber, and all compute, storage, and processing as part of a comprehensive zero-trust architecture. 2 .  Connectivity: Connectivity:  Connectivity is an obvious consideration whether using ethernet, 5G, LTE, satellite, or other capability. GDIT has specific and secure architectures for all these connectivity scenarios as well as recommended, well-developed use cases for each. Regardless of the connectivity solution or status, the user’s ability to be productive must not be impacted. 3 .  Device Management: Device Management:  Agencies must have the visibility and ability to control endpoint devices - from typical laptops to sensors and Internet of Things devices. All must be secure and up to date on any required patching. GDIT has unified endpoint management approaches spanning many types of devices that must be connected at the edge. 4 .  Supply Chain Supply Chain : Supply Chain risks must also be addressed. Devices are made from a multitude of parts and software is built with code from around world. It is therefore imperative to ensure that they have not been compromised or manipulated. GDIT accomplishes our supply chain validation through strategic alliance partnerships and by leveraging our own internal supply chain verification approaches. 5 .  Applications and Services: Applications and Services:  Applications and services running at the edge are a critical component of a robust edge capability. A mere 10% of all data ingestion and processing is being completed at the edge today, which means that 90% is being done in centralized data centers. This model is inefficient and limits the types of capabilities an agency can provide to users regardless of their work location or circumstances. While cloud computing is an optimal alternative in many scenarios, edge has become a viable option in many others. However, in many cases, legacy models and application architectures must be refactored or new edge applications must be created.

With this in mind, it’s OUR INDUSTRIES OUR INDUSTRIES Learn more about GDIT’s culture and how we carefully cultivate it across our organization. INTELLIGENCE critical for leaders to be intentional about team camaraderie, about creating an open environment for sharing ideas, and retaining top talent. So, this team invested in several culture-building best practices that are proving to be instructional for teams throughout GDIT. Set Aside Time and Budget for Team-Building Events Though it’s not possible on every contract, this team sets aside time and budget every quarter to hold team-building events in a social setting outside of the office. These events give team members an opportunity to welcome new hires and connect with each other as individuals. They also present opportunities for team members to interact with leadership (and vice versa) and create touchpoints for team members from other locations to plan potential travel around. Additionally, between these team-building events, team members are encouraged to connect via phone versus online, or to include time for small talk in meetings. Leaders model this behavior, and it contributes to greater camaraderie and connectivity team wide. Create Opportunities for Team Members at All Levels to Engage with the Customer Another important practice on this team involves customer visibility. Leadership frequently brings staff-level team members into customer meetings, often asking them to present or answer questions from the customer. As one team member put it,  “leadership wants the team to shine,”  and opportunities abound for them to do just that. There’s real value in creating those opportunities for people, coaching them before and after, and signaling trust in team members’ abilities to present their work product to the customer. Promote Transparency, Autonomy and Experimentation Whenever Possible This team also works diligently and intentionally to promote transparency, autonomy, and experimentation whenever possible. Here’s an example of all three at work: At a recent team happy hour, a management-level team member and a member of leadership were discussing how to drive even more efficiency on the already-efficient team. The team member suggesting gamifying tickets among the operations team. She was told to run with the idea. So, she came up with a plan, communicated it to the team, incentivized team members to participate and, as a result, the group (and, ultimately, the customer) will see an increase in the speed at which they were able to resolve tickets. As one manger told us,  “Top-down is not the M.O. This culture of autonomy and experimentation is reinforcing. The more we do it, the better we get at it and the stronger the team gets.” Allow Exposure and Opportunity to Drive Retention and Mobility Finally, team members tell us that the culture of opportunity and exposure helps to drive retention. Leadership is incredibly engaged and is also technically capable. This helps them, and by extension the team, stay close to the customer and to build a relationship based on consistently solving problems for them. One leader told us,  “I’m a better leader when I understand how things work. The details matter and you have to understand this stuff so you can make the right decisions.”  Additionally, when people are working in an environment where they can do their best work and can be recognized for it, they’re more likely to stay on the contract and progress their careers. This means the company, the team, and the customer all retain that knowledge and benefit from it in the long run. Win, win, win. Today, this team and this customer enjoy better working relationships, increased loyalty and staff retention, knowledge retention across products and the customer, and a consistent level of knowledge and dependability across the team. One team member summed it up pretty nicely, saying,  Through multiple levels of interactions, the customer has a better understanding of our organization and how things work and why, and that helps everybody.”  TAGS TAGS INTELLIGENCE  Related 14MIN WATCH INTELLIGENCE,  HOMELAND SECURITY,  DIGITAL MODERNIZATION Biometric Identification:  Not Movie Magic, But a Mosaic of Multi-Factor Authentication Tools 3 MIN READ INTELLIGENCE,  HOMELAND SECURITY,  CLOUD 5 Data Center Best Practices That Have Nothing To Do With Technology 3 MIN READ ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,  DATA AND ANALYTICS,  HOMELAND SECURITY, … INTELLIGENCE Applying Geospatial Intelligence and AI/ML to the Climate Change Challenge 3 MIN READ LOGISTICS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT,  INTELLIGENCE,  HOMELAND … SECURITY Powerful Analytics that Save Money and Safeguard the Mission "

5G Enables AI at the Edge,"5G, Artificial Intelligence and Edge Computing have been areas of focus in the IT space for some time. GDIT is testing AI at the Edge in its 5G Emerge Lab. 5G enables massive machine-to-machine connectivity and allows for connected sensors and devices to ""speak"" to each other without connecting to an enterprise or hub. As edge computing becomes ubiquitous, it will start to compete with the cloud as a compute and storage commodity and could disrupt current offerings from cellular network operators. Netflix stores data in massive data centers in Virginia and California, but locally they’re using Akamai relays to cache data at the neighborhood level.

This allows for devices to manage themselves and react to data inputs from other devices, even without connecting to a cloud or centralized server. By leveraging embedded algorithms and even machine learning at the edge, we’re at the beginning of what will become a smart and independent mesh network of devices. One example is how smart city traffic lights can automatically adjust to control or regulate the flow of traffic without communicating to a central server. As edge computing like this becomes ubiquitous, it will start to compete with the cloud as a compute and storage commodity. This may provide alternative physical locations for storage and compute for existing cloud vendors, and it could disrupt them altogether with potential new offerings from cellular network operators. We’re already seeing the beginning of this from content distribution services. Netflix stores data in massive data centers in Virginia and California, but locally they’re using Akamai relays to cache data at the neighborhood level. Blurred Lines Demand Advanced Cybersecurity In this example and hundreds like it, as data moves from place to place with encryption at both ends, 5G and edge are, in effect, blurring the lines and creating a larger and more diverse attack surface in need of advanced cybersecurity. On top of that, more complex system architectures are built on more complex Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) services that abstract the cloud and edge compute and storage locations. There are also more complex layers of containerization involved. No longer will cyber teams be able to think about security in local, cloud or on-prem contexts. In environments where everything is virtualized and when it’s not exactly clear where the data is at any given moment, or when serverless systems are being leveraged, cybersecurity becomes more important than ever. So, too, does having a secure software supply chain. Look no further than the recent log4j breach. As ever-more complex systems enable ever-more complex capabilities, it can be easy to focus on the delivery of functionality without looking back at how and what software is being used and how secure it is. The stakes are even higher for government and Department of Defense customers and their mission partners.  As a systems integrator, GDIT has broad and deep capabilities that address these complexities and the stakes – both today and for the future. This includes our 5G Emerge Lab that proves out 5G solutions and demonstrates how we can securely connect and protect 5G-enabled devices, data, and applications across the broader enterprise. Underpinning Technologies Paved the Way Paving the way for what’s to come with regard to AI at the edge, are a host of underpinning technologies. Containerization, as mentioned above, helps to quickly move applications into the cloud. Virtualization abstracts applications from physical hardware. Graphical Processing Units, or GPUs, allow us to accelerate workloads. Gaming engines gave us the blueprint for reusing software components or to more quickly port applications to other platforms. Today, GDIT is leveraging these advances as well as the capabilities offered by 5G to enable AI at the edge on a diverse array of use cases – from training and simulations that leverage virtual reality on edge devices, to medical trainings with smart mannequins. We are also exploring how to use AI and guided assistance within Denied, Disrupted, Intermittent, and Limited bandwidth (DDIL) environments. Another use case involves deploying smart warehouse technology on edge devices for logistics and supply chain management purposes. What is clearer than ever is that teams are just scratching the surface of the enormous potential of AI at the edge. 5G, and the continued bandwidth enhancements that will come after it, will expand that potential exponentially. And we stand ready to capitalize on it, exploring the art of the possible, for customers.

OUR INDUSTRIES OUR INDUSTRIES Learn more about GDIT's Health portfolio. HEALTH Indian Health Service has an important mission to provide health services to American Indian and Alaska Native communities. In what ways has GDIT supported the agency and tribal communities? GDIT has been supporting the IHS mission for two decades and has worked with the agency to provide integral services to raise health access and availability to 2.6 million American Indians and Alaska Natives. One of the programs we lead is the Software Engineering and Support Services and the Health IT Resource and Patient Management System, or RPMS, a comprehensive patient information system used by IHS. We deliver IT services such as software engineering, application, help desk, and operational maintenance for the system. As the prime contractor for the past five years, we’ve implemented over 500 upgrades and resolved over 4,000 help desk requests. We have made several important enhancements to RPMS directly supporting better patient healthcare and improving outcomes. GDIT developed and implemented iCare, a comprehensive view of patient information at an individual and population level that is currently used to enhance clinical decision making. And we implemented a personal health record (PHR) that allows patients to access their health information. This also includes a direct messaging feature so providers can send secure messages to patients. The benefits of these efforts lowered cost, improved clinician collaboration and reduced risk across patient continuity of care. Focusing on improving community-based care is essential to improving the lives of Alaskan Indians / American Natives. For several ongoing and new RPMS software development projects, we have provided support to 15,000 users of RPMS software, delivering on time and on budget. We recently implemented a 2015 Meaningful Use Certification for electronic health records, or EHR, applications, completing the 18-month project in under eight months. This ONC certification ensured certified health IT meets strict capability, functionality, and security requirements adopted by HHS. During COVID-19 response, we were able to bring innovations to the agency, developing the COVID vaccination and lab reporting systems. We successfully onboarded over 200 sites across AI/AN communities and contributed to the data transformation solution populating the Four Directions Hub (4DH) Patient Index, a web-based tool that creates a single source of information for a patient. IHS faces unique requirements in implementing a modern electronic health record, or EHR, system. Can you expand on these challenges and how the agency can address them? Implementing a modern EHR is more than just technology and processes. It needs to be focused on the people and patient outcomes. For IHS, a successful implementation means working with the diverse patient population, tribal partners, and area offices with unique relationships with IHS. Compliance with tribal, state, and federal reporting requires an emphasis on situational awareness and effective governance. We are architecting a solution that is scalable across 567 tribes, 37 states and over 600 medical facilities, and one that is interoperable to provide functionality and capabilities that meet adaptive environments supporting acute, ambulatory, urgent, emergency, and post-acute care. Currently, each tribal site has a choice on what health record and health IT system they use, creating many disparate sources of information and systems that don’t work with one another. Our solution ensures a comprehensive data migration and conversion tool that cohesively combines data from financial, clinical and administrative data across these disparate health IT systems. It’s standing up a new, modern environment accessible across IHS, tribal, and urban sites, Implementation is a process, one that requires precise goals and milestones with effective governance. Onboarding third party EHRs currently in use and installed in tribal sites will also lower barriers to adoption of the new system featuring longitudinal health record – a comprehensive record of a patient’s health experiences. When a patient receives care from different physicians and clinics, having this information integrated and accessible at future health visits allows for better patient care and outcomes. How do partners contribute to a successful EHR implementation? We’ve brought together a robust team to address core needs of IHS for their EHR system. This exclusive team joins us with both federal and commercial expertise in healthcare and health IT to fully deliver on these requirements. This team will allow us to address core needs of the EHR for population health, health information exchange, interoperability to work together with other systems, and the associated implementation and training at each tribal and IHS site. Our key integration and service partners bring expertise in clinical applications, management, and governance across all services within the technical solution. One of the challenges you mention is the great complexity in delivering a modern EHR system. What positions GDIT to overcome these challenges for an agency of this size and geographically dispersed across the country? A unique aspect compared to other agencies is that IHS serves 567 federally recognized Tribes across the country that each manage their own governance and community, which includes healthcare. Providing a system that will help each independent site provide better patient care is the goal of the EHR system, and we emphasize three main areas in our solution. The first is repeatable and predictable EHR implementation. A strong foundation will allow uniformity yet adaptability to the services offered by each medical site. The second is medical discipline alignment – aligning the medical specialty areas, such as dialysis, dental, optometry, epidemiology, behavioral health, for example, with primary care. This facilitates a continuity of care and address areas like chronic disease management and equal access to care. And the final component is interoperability, ensuring the new EHR works with other health information exchanges, state, public, health, and federal agencies. This will allow IHS to direct and validate data across Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense as well. Interoperability will improve situational awareness, care demand and utilization of current resources. Providing the right tools in challenging environments reminds us that core important mission, supporting the health and wellbeing of the American Indians and Alaska Natives.

What are agencies prioritizing and how can they address challenges to achieve true zero trust maturity? During this webinar, subject matter experts from GDIT and  Appgate  provide recommendations on where agencies should place their priorities and the steps they should consider to meet EO requirements. Federal IT and line of business managers know that implementing zero trust is a strategic approach to defend against cyber threats. Ahead of the 2024 deadline, federal agencies are making progress in their zero trust implementation, according to the study. But agencies also recognize the challenges they face and know there’s still important work to do.  Read the full report here. The executive order requires government agencies to achieve specific zero trust security goals by the end of fiscal year 2024. 63% of respondents said their agencies will meet these requirements on time or early. 92% are confident in their agency’s ability to defend against cyber threats. 76% have a formal zero trust strategy in place, with 52% actively implementing one. But, with such a major undertaking against an ambitious timeline, challenges remain. 58% said one of the primary challenges to implementing zero trust architecture is rebuilding or replacing existing legacy infrastructure. 50% are having trouble identifying what technologies they need. 48% think their agencies lack sufficient IT staff expertise. “When some agencies still have data on mainframes or legacy systems, it’s a big challenge,” said Dr. John Sahlin, cyber solutions director for GDIT’s defense division. “Agencies know they can't bolt on zero trust, so they must decide to rebuild or replace systems. That requires additional spending on top of investing in zero trust. Agencies have to make some hard decisions.” The research study,  Agency Guide to Zero Trust Maturity , conducted by GDIT in partnership with  Market Connections , a leading research firm, surveyed 300 federal government officials in federal civilian and defense agencies to determine insights around their zero trust journeys, challenges, and progress toward meeting the EO deadline.

From digital modernization to managed services, cloud to artificial intelligence, our technology solutions enable veterans to access the services – how, when and where they need them. A prime example of this work is the prototype  Skin Lesion Classifier  we recently developed and piloted with the VA. Today, a veteran with a skin lesion typically sees a Primary Care Provider (PCP) for a diagnosis. The PCP uses a camera to take an image of the lesion. The image is sent to dermatologists, centralized at 18 Veterans Integrated Services Networks (VISNs) around the country, for review. Any issues with image quality are detected days later, and poor-quality images require the veteran to return for another image and start the whole process over again. Aside from being inconvenient and inefficient, this process may delay the start of potentially life-saving treatment. Once a clinically helpful image is captured, the dermatologist can then classify the lesion as potentially malignant or benign and can order more tests or make a diagnosis and, if necessary, begin treatment. In late 2020 and into 2021, GDIT participated in the VA’s Artificial Intelligence (AI) Tech Sprint sponsored by the VA National AI Institute (NAII). These “sprints” are meant to empower teams to quickly prototype AI capabilities that meet a critical need within the VA. Together with the Chief of Dermatologist at the VA Healthcare System in Ann Arbor, Michigan, our team developed a Skin Lesion Classifier that can assesses the quality of an image of a skin lesion to determine whether it was clinically useful. Further, the service then classifies clinically useful images into one of seven skin diseases. For those skin diseases known to be malignant, the solution recommends immediate follow- up care. GDIT’s Skin Lesion Classifier was ranked third by the VA among more than 40 teams. To do it, the team employed artificial intelligence transfer learning. They compared eight image classifiers built using deep learning algorithms including ResNet, VGGNet, and other Convolutional Neural Network models. The classifiers were trained on a library of 10,000 publically available skin lesion images. From there, the team selected the most accurate model and built a cloud-based, containerized solution that could assess the images, identify a lesion as either malignant or benign, classify the condition, and make follow-up care recommendations. In addition, the team explored explanability approaches to help explain the decision to evaluators by outlining the features and elements of an image that impacted its classification. Since completing this sprint, the team has proposed a follow-on pilot field effort to collect more images images, from a wider diversity of skin types, with presentations of a wider array of conditions – so that the classifier can be applied to more diseases and skin types  to make make even more precise recommendations. In addition, the pilot includes evaluation by oncologists to assess the accuracy and usabability of the solution. We are excited about the potential of AI to improve the care veterans receive and accelerate treatment of skin conditions and cancers. This is especially important today because the COVID-19 pandemic delayed many routine screenings and imaging. Undetected conditions that persisted for months must be discovered and treated as quickly as possible to ensure the best possible outcomes for veterans. The AI solution is hosted in a web based interface, providing a telehealth option that contributes to greater access to care for veterans in rural or underserved populations, for whom making repeated, return trips to centralized VA specialized care locations can become inconvenient, costly, or even unfeasible. Together with our VA partners, GDIT was able to collaborate and build this tool that will have a meaningful and lasting impact and will enable the VA to better deliver on its mission.

The Cyber EO requires all Federal agencies to develop a detailed plan to implement a zero trust architecture. The Office of Management and Budget and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)  published its final version of zero trust strategy in January , which provides roadmaps for agencies to transition to zero trust models and securely migrate to cloud services over the next two years. Here are some steps to consider in the process: Define the protect surface: Define the protect surface:  Everything starts with the data; you can’t defend what you don’t know you have. The first step is to conduct an audit of the data, applications, and other services you use within your network. Identify these elements, determine where they reside, and start categorizing them by value and risk. Map data transaction flows: Map data transaction flows:  A critical component of zero trust is preventing adversaries from moving laterally in your environment to access other assets. It’s critical to understand how and where data flows – across all five key pillars. With a map of your environment, you can create enforcement points throughout your architecture to secure, manage and monitor devices, users, applications, and other network activity. Architect the environment: Architect the environment:  Define the technology capabilities you need to defend the protect surface and data transaction flows across the five key pillars. For example, from an identity perspective, implementing identity, credential, and access management solutions (ICAM) will enable you to track user identities across the network and ensure access is limited to only those who can verify they need it. Create policies around access: Create policies around access:   Consider who needs access to what data and applications, and what security standards must their devices meet to gain access. Monitor and maintain: Monitor and maintain:  Define how you will monitor and maintain your environment going forward to assess your protect surface and enforce policies. Automated decisions around trust, such as looking for suspicious network activity and shutting it down at machine speed, are needed at scale – and investments are necessary. These five steps named in the guidance, which must be met by the end of Fiscal Year 2024, closely align with the five pillars of the Zero Trust Maturity Model published by the CISA. The Importance of Partnership As agencies modernize their cybersecurity programs, they must approach every decision – across technology, process, and people – with a zero trust mindset. It’s important that agencies seek an industry partner with holistic, enterprise-wide experience and expertise across all five zero trust pillars to help guide them on their journey. Agencies need a partner who has the required capabilities as well as proven experience developing reference architectures. Trusted partners in the cyber industry know that cyber is not a singular part of the mission – it’s the thread that connects every endpoint, network, and person. GDIT, for example, has worked with the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) on its  ICAM program , to identify efficiencies, facilitate strong authentication to cloud services, provide authorization services with role-based access, and enable better and faster audits of users and resources. This program is a critical pillar of the Department of Defense’s (DoD) ultimate push toward a zero trust architecture. Agencies can also look to trusted partners  to leverage zero trust architecture  to modernize their infrastructure and secure their move to the cloud. As the DoD continues to migrate its users to the Defense Enterprise Office Solution (DEOS), the cloud-based environment that will deliver collaboration services to the DoD, zero trust architectures will provide an added layer of security and authentication to support rapid migration. “ As agencies modernize their cybersecurity programs, they must approach every decision – across technology, process, and people – with a zero trust mindset. It’s important that agencies seek an industry partner with holistic, enterprise-wide experience and expertise across all five zero trust pillars to help guide them on their journey.  ” Dr. Matthew McFadden Dr. Matthew McFadden Vice President, Cyber & Distinguished Technologist Opportunity Ahead While advancing toward a zero trust architecture is a challenging undertaking for our government, it is a necessary evolution to help us meet today’s sophisticated cyber threats head-on. Ultimately, zero trust will serve as an enabler for broader digital transformation, making it easier and more secure for agency users to work productively and safely from any device, from any location. The requirements and timelines outlined in the Cyber EO are ambitious, representing a monumental shift across how government networks are secured, software is procured, and cyber teams operate and collaborate. It’s important to get started today. Take small steps, make forward progress, iterate over time, and use lessons learned to make informed decisions for the future. And you don’t need to do it alone – seek out a partner who can support you every step of the journey.

TRAINING AND SIMULATION"," OUR CAPABILITIES OUR CAPABILITIES Learn more about how GDIT’s Strategy and Performance Group  designs, implements, and evaluates comprehensive learning programs and platforms. TRAINING AND SIMULATION Without question, education technology is constantly changing, and so are the needs of students. The sudden shift to remote working, schooling, and training during the pandemic showed all of us how essential it is to have thoughtful, consistent, and available education technology and delivery platforms. Education technology is a suite of tools and applications that enhance processes. It consists of many components and applications including Learning Management Systems (LMS), Content Management Systems (CMS), virtual classrooms, and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, to name a few. The most effective approach to using education technology is to analyze, design, develop, implement, and evaluate the instructional environment, with the goal of continuous improvement to content, delivery, and learning. Addressing technology challenges is important. But it is just as important to create a culture of constant learning and evaluation. Because we have come to expect education technology to be present in every aspect of life to enhance learning, it’s never been more important for agencies to evaluate and upgrade their education technology. Transforming information into knowledge, transferring knowledge through technology GDIT is known as a top tier Information Technology Company.  We pride ourselves on providing innovative and industry leading IT support in education and training. We facilitate the transformation of information into knowledge by converting data into relevant, clear, and concise content. GDIT partners with agencies to evaluate and update their learning ecosystems and helps ensure education technology is a catalyst, not a hindrance, for success. We select, exploit, and improve technical learning platforms to serve as outstanding mechanisms for knowledge transfer. We believe in four education technology imperatives leaders must consider when upgrading their legacy training environments: 1. Evaluate applications regularly to ensure they are current and effective. Educators and technology leaders must collaborate to ensure technology initiatives align with overall organizational priorities to create flexible, high quality learning environments for all students. Contemporary education technology has enabled businesses, governments, and schools to perform more efficiently. As such, we have come to expect education technology to be present in every aspect of life and to enhance learning. Real-time information and communications are available at our fingertips and, if properly implemented, can improve education. 2. Prepare to replace any suboptimal systems or technologies. Newer technology can substantially improve capabilities, yield cost savings, and lead to increased efficiency, student engagement, and educational success. The shortcomings of legacy systems forced many organizations to quickly reassess current setups and start migrating to systems that met the demands of the new landscape. This gave more capabilities and better assistance to educators, resulting in learning experiences that fostered inclusivity and boosted the learning potential of all students. This degree of agility, pivoting when it becomes clear it’s necessary, must continue. 3. Review upgraded technology solutions and how those fit within your learning environment. The purpose of properly aligned education technology is to enhance the learning experience. Two factors that are key to the success of online learning initiatives are students’ success and teachers’ evaluation of the tools. Therefore, it is important to consult these two essential stakeholder groups, alongside your IT teams, to evaluate how to improve existing solutions or, if necessary, how to integrate and optimize new ones. 4. Ensure gains outweigh any deficiencies left by upgrading legacy technology. Education technology is so valuable because it can address learning needs across categories: Synchronous and Asynchronous; Linear Learning; and Collaborative Learning. Agencies should ensure that gains from replacement technology enable all of the types of learning their organizations use, provide opportunities for additional learning experiences, and that it enhances the overall experience for users.

While that’s a correct description, it’s only partly so. OUR CAPABILITIES OUR CAPABILITIES Learn more about GDIT’s application development work and our innovative technology delivery models. APPLICATION SERVICES At GDIT, we view a software factory as a combination of many things – a platform, tools, people, and a culture of continuous innovation/continuous deployment (CI/CD) that, together, enable us to develop solutions that delight our customers. That distinction is important. Because just as a typical factory can’t operate without people, neither can a software factory. Instead, we view the factory as an enabling technology for producing solutions quickly and creating a culture of exploration. It’s a collaborative, innovation-oriented environment where developers can think differently about solving problems. Here’s why: In our software factory approach, GDIT leverages automation to create repeatable ways to build software with high quality, high security, and low risk. “ We give teams a common platform and templates build from while also encouraging teams to be innovative, to experiment, to fail fast, to continuously improve and deliver products that are truly aligned to our customers’ needs.  ” Jay Olsen Jay Olsen Vice President, Application Services Technology In this way, the software factory is so much more than a set of tools; it’s a way to create opportunities for staff to upskill and, in turn, for us to invest in our staff. We do this via a robust training program, internal tech challenges, and development methodologies that invite curiosity and ingenuity. Our software factory integrates industry-leading virtual collaboration solutions that enable remote teams to efficiently design and develop creative solutions in a shared digital workspace. The software factory approach has served us well. We use it today on more than 20 programs. On one program using this approach, we have not a single critical bug for more than five years. On another program, we were able to use a software factory approach to drive productivity by 47 percent. At a third, we were able to downsize headcount on a program without sacrificing productivity. Additionally, many software development opportunities from agencies now include mandates around the use of Agile-type development methodologies and frequent CI/CD. This means we have had to think about how we plan our work and deliver incremental value delivery to our customers, faster. The software factory approach has been instrumental to our ability to do that. Going a step further, the software factory approach helps us execute successful modernization efforts as well. As agencies look to modernize their systems and tools, the people and processes around those tools and systems have to be modernized as well. The software factory mindset and approach enable us to take a holistic approach to these modernization projects that ultimately results in better outcomes. The same is true for sustainment projects.  In fact, with IT projects of many types, part of the journey involves creating a roadmap for teams to grow and change the way they operate. A software factory approach makes that possible and aids in an important mindset and culture shift that is essential to these projects’ success. By focusing on our people, and by investing in the things that will make them even more effective and even more successful in their roles, the GDIT software factory approach is paying dividends for us and for our customers.

CYBER predicated on the previous block’s hash. Most often associated with cryptocurrency, there are applications for blockchain and its principles across many industries, including the federal government.  Below I’ve broken down five things for federal agencies to know about blockchain. “ Most often associated with cryptocurrency, there are applications for blockchain and its principles across many industries, including the federal government. ” Michael Carter Michael Carter Principal Solutions Architect, Enterprise Blockchain and Cryptocurrency 1. Blockchain is about workflows and participants Any workflow in business typically has steps performed, tracks who completes those steps, and a series of verifications by an independent party, but all the information is held in a database, sometimes with different parts of the workflow in multiple databases with limited access and transparency for security reasons. In a blockchain, everyone in a workflow shares the same database at the metadata layer, which can point participants to off-chain databases if they are needed. Together, they’re creating a co-located system of record to log steps in a process and verifying that they were the one performing a task. As a result, blockchain participants are collectively creating a constantly up-to-date database that doesn’t require maintenance by a third-party. Instead, you have this consensus-based orchestration of a canonical process with lots of participants. A great example of this is when data quality and highly secure storage are important, such as if an agency needs multiple parties to first approve that specific documents are correct and appropriate, track those approvals in an auditable and permissioned way, and then store those documents immutably for future reference. This happens frequently in judicial and investigative programs, such as where the FBI may need to prove evidence chain-of-custody when building a case. 2. Blockchain, when used as part of smart contract architecture, can lean-out middleware Smart contracts are programs that can be stored on a blockchain and programmed to automatically run when certain conditions are met. A lot of basic process functions can be nested in a smart contract – in a database world, this would be akin to a stored procedure. Eventually, the evolution of the smart contract architecture will lean out middleware and create better business processes, making them leaner in both cost and in implementation. The idea of having leaner processes can result in all sorts of operational efficiencies and savings for organizations of all types. 3. Blockchain can enable process optimization for risk management Anytime there is a process, people working through that process, and an exchange of information, there is inherent risk. When a stored contract is set to run automatically once predetermined conditions are met, you remove all the human error risk associated with that function. Automation on the blockchain identifies when the conditions are met, and atomically executes steps in the process as a result upheld by the integrity of the consensus to ensure only the digital signatures of the contract execute the automation. In a similar vein as microservices, components of smart contracts can be highly reusable and reduce duplication, including the aforementioned calls to off- chain data sources via “oracles” (essentially API’s which bring real-world data to the smart contract so that it can be triggered when a threshold is met). An example of this is in shipping sensitive medicines, where IIoT data (industrial internet of things) from temperature, humidity, and geospatial sensors feeds data to the smart contract: once the shipment arrives at a certain coordinate, if no violations of pre-agreed shipping parameters occurred, the smart contract can release funds which had been sitting in verifiable escrow to the sender. All this automation is both transparent from the outset, removes the need for third parties (e.g. escrow-holders), and reduces overall manual labor in processes. 4. Blockchain can transform human capital Organizations that leverage blockchain to streamline existing processes can transform entire, task-based departments and enable humans to focus on higher value work. Blockchain has introduced us to the concept of decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs. On one end of the spectrum, agencies can use DAOs to absorb entire functions and deliver better, faster services; on the other end, they can simply take an existing process and co-locate just a few aspects of it on a blockchain and test its impact. Chain-of-custody in hardware asset management is important to many agencies, and once a process and system of IoT devices, scanning and transferring is implemented, can lead to much faster audits and easier accountability. 5. Blockchain is not suitable for every problem, and that’s ok For all its virtues, there are instances where blockchain is not a fit. And there’s a reason. Blockchain, because it’s predicated on consensus and sharing information that builds on prior information, creates a natural immutable retention of that information. From a privacy standpoint, that can be problematic. We’re still early in the blockchain era and there’s a lot of discovery around how certain personally identifiable information, or PII data, lives on the blockchain and where and how in the stack it can be securely stored. Despite the security attributes of blockchain, we should never assume any system is impenetrable. There are a variety of architectures for handling sensitive information rather than storing it as a single file in a block. It can be ""sharded,"" or sliced into fragments with various (duplicated) pieces being stored in a distributed way and only able to be reconstituted by a unique identifier and a secret key. Or, we can use more contemporary methods, such as maintaining the sensitive data in a well-protected consolidated database where the pointer to that database is kept in hashed (encoded) format on the blockchain. In the latter case, this leverages blockchain for tracking state changes to the underlying information for audit and security purposes, but allows for editing and erasure of that data in cases where it is warranted (such erasure could not occur if it is embedded in a block; in this case, it could only be superseded by a more recent block indicating updates). As agencies explore blockchain and what it can offer, my advice would be to take a crawl-walk-run approach. Co-locate a few aspects of an existing system of records and use a blockchain-style approach to continually add onto it to understand the network effect and what blockchain can do for you. Don't try to solve everything in your first project. Blockchain is new and exciting technology. Rather than be mystified or intimidated by it, just start.

There is no greater example of the threats that could impact the nation’s critical aviation infrastructure than 9/11. On that day, I was the federal program manager for the FAA’s Leased Interfacility National Airspace System Communications System. The attacks on the World Trade Center with the damage to the surrounding buildings severed commercial telecommunications, and yet that critical pilot-to-air- traffic-controller link remained intact due to designed-in network diversity. With the FAA focusing on essential and integrated technology capabilities across its portfolio, we’re seeing even more commitment to securing our national communications infrastructure first outlined in an Executive Order issued 60 years ago and reinforced in the recent 2021 Executive Order on Cybersecurity  to include cyber concerns. And so are we at GDIT. For more than 50 years, we’ve been both a thought partner and a technical expert to the FAA as it works to continually secure its critical communications infrastructure. There are five focus areas to ensure safety and availability of critical aviation communications: Security-first design approach Security-first design approach : implementing new technologies and approaches to security that constantly enhance the safety of FAA communications systems. Cybersecurity at the forefront: Cybersecurity at the forefront:  ensuring the FAA’s industrial control system similarly applies processes and procedures with cybersecurity in mind. Implement Zero Trust architecture: Implement Zero Trust architecture:  GDIT’s Zero Trust expertise is being applied to realize the security promise of this approach being implemented at the FAA. Strengthen ICAM capabilities: Strengthen ICAM capabilities:  the agency’s identity credential and access management (ICAM) capabilities will strengthen its security posture and drive availability through resilient infrastructures. Incorporate automation, artificial intelligence and machine learning: Incorporate automation, artificial intelligence and machine learning:  By automating rules-driven processes and procedures, alongside inference-based tasks that models can be trained to handle, the focus can be shifted to higher value-order tasks, while enhancing the overall cybersecurity posture. Safer skies, from takeoff to touchdown The criticality of keeping FAA teams securely connected to aircraft in our skies is a mission we take very seriously and one for which we apply an enormous amount of expertise to get right. In addition to a security-first approach, we partner with the FAA to keep our domestic airspace safe. Software built for the National Airspace System is relied upon every day by the FAA to calculate and recommend standard maneuvers like arrivals, departures, and rerouting, and Traffic Flow Management uses intelligent automation to assist in all phases of flight. Mission-critical and safety-essential FAA network services, like the FAA’s Administrative Voice Enterprise Service (FAVES), rely on the deployment and sustainment of the latest networking services, legacy protocol support, and cyberthreat detection. GDIT provides telecommunications Voice over IP systems to more than 1,000 FAA facilities for seamless, secure, always-on communications. Finally, we secure the FAA’s gateway to the cloud and critical applications including FAA DroneZone, the registration platform for public and commercial unmanned aircraft, and the UAS data exchange Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability (LAANC) flight planning tool. In my current role at GDIT, I see our cyber professionals’ skills put to the test every day to secure operations for the FAA’s IT infrastructure, cloud services, and VoIP communications. Their understanding and commitment to the safety, security and protection of this critical infrastructure ensures the vital link between pilots, air traffic controllers, airway facilities specialists, and every aviation professional is never compromised. Mariano Alicea has nearly 25 years’ experience supporting the National Airspace System (NAS) and air traffic control systems and over 10 years supporting telecommunications network services. As GDIT Vice President for Transportation and Infrastructure, he manages a business area with over 400 employees nationwide and oversees large customer programs including FAA Cloud Services (FCS), FAA Administrative Voice Enterprise Services (FAVES), and Traffic Flow Management System. He formerly held positions with the FAA as a program manager where he was responsible for the FAA’s complex communications network during 9/11 and oversight of the post-9/11 security environment.

CYBER Delivering enterprise solutions to drive the mission forward But truly exceptional cyber teams build comprehensive and effective solutions that are part of an ecosystem of applications and services, all using the same data. These teams and their work reflect the reality that the days of “an app for this” are over. Instead, it’s about delivering integrated solutions that a customer can choose from, with all the services connected on the backend, so that they can stay focused on the mission rather than on “the IT of the mission.” GDIT cyber teams deliver this commercial-like, ecosystem experience. As one example, we run the largest managed services IT program in the intelligence community, and we’ve done so for more than 20 years. Under the program, GDIT delivers capabilities with components working together to provide a consolidated view from multiple products that are integrated into the security monitoring and ITSM management and control sub-systems. As a mission solutions partner, we provide integrated solutions that deliver the best return on investment and the lowest total cost of ownership  while also  meeting mission objectives and requirements. We understand our customers, their environments and their goals and we ensure the systems we engineer can communicate with one another.

We’ve developed a comprehensive internal training program as well as a talent pipeline partnership with select colleges and universities. Through these relationships, we can identify talented sophomores and juniors and prepare them for careers with GDIT. We ensure they have the prerequisite knowledge to work on programs and guide their final years of study. We’ve also developed a training model that allows our people to rotate off of programs and into training programs periodically. Going a step further, we also allocate a portion of team members’ time on a program toward training so that they have the opportunity to stay sharp and, ultimately, deliver better service to customers. To date, 3,215 cyber team members have completed 9,573 hours of training on topics like algorithmic programming to facilitate discovery and automated responses (with human oversight and approvals), and more. These trainings, facilitated by our Cybersecurity Center of Excellence, contribute to a culture where people are encouraged to become continual learners. This industry changes so quickly. A mere 18 months is a generation. And in cybersecurity in particular, adversaries are adapting their approaches all the time. We bring in new products and capabilities and are rapidly developing and deploying new ones. This all requires a workforce that is ready and able to use and support these tools. Our training and recruitment partnerships  allow us to continually evolve our tech culture and our people, building a next-generation cybersecurity workforce that matches the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape that we help our customers navigate.

MANAGED SERVICES"," Increasingly adopted over the last several years, a Managed Services model allows an agency to consume services based on a well- defined set of outcomes rather than focusing on all the hardware, software, and underlying services. A Managed Services Provider (MSP) like GDIT is then responsible for managing all the underlying components. OUR CAPABILITIES OUR CAPABILITIES Learn more about driving the outcomes you need with Managed Services. MANAGED SERVICES Adopting Managed Services with well-documented desired outcomes from a trusted provider like GDIT allows agencies to achieve long- term efficiencies by standardizing and optimizing services, technologies, and delivery methods that can create economies of scale. This approach also helps delivers higher quality service at a lower cost because it improves a service and is transparent and predictable. In fact, according to a  joint study between FedScoop and GDIT , agencies’ top five motivators for moving to Managed Services were cost savings and control; mission focus; service performance; risk reduction; and workforce support. Because this approach is based on industry-best and commercial practices, while tailored to the outcomes of the agency, it drives an improved customer experience.  This is important for a few reasons, not the least of which is that every agency should continuously work to improve the services it offers. Another reason is that  improving customer service is the intent of a recently issued Executive Order whose intent is to recommit the country to being “of the people, by the people, and for the people” in solving the complex 21st Century challenges ahead of us. The order calls on agencies to design and deliver services with a focus on the experience of the people it is meant to serve, and challenges agencies to deliver services more equitably and effectively, especially for those who have been historically underserved. GDIT strives to deliver transformative Managed Services – wherein we quickly deliver holistic results, improve experiences for users, provide immediate and far-reaching value alongside stability and continuity, and collaboratively develop service-specific outcomes to measure performance. As an example, we transformed the  Department of Veterans Affairs Enterprise Service Desk  that supports over 500,000 VA personnel to a Managed Service model within six months while ensuring the VA was always able to support their operations and mission. The team has consistently outperformed its service level agreements (SLAs) with over 98% satisfaction rate and 99% first-call resolution. Additionally, 99% of VA self-service portal issues are responded to within one business day and user feedback has shown that self-service options, like addressing account lockouts, have dramatically enhanced the user experience. Often many traditional outsourcing agreements will have suppliers focused on supplier performance. While supplier performance is important, what’s more important is the result or outcome of the services delivered.  For example, if a service provider is managing a claims processing system what you might care most about is that claims are processed expeditiously rather than measuring system uptime of the system. Without question, moving to a Managed Services approach comes with inherent challenges, but GDIT’s experience and approach helps customers avoid these challenges and successfully navigate the transition. We apply organizational change management practices to identify and overcome potential issues like feasibility challenges, complacency with the status quo, and general negative perceptions to the change. Our approach mitigates common demotivators within the agency, always maintaining security control, providing transparent pricing inclusive of hardware/software/underpinning services, and through strong governance led by the agency. Managed Services transformations and a drive to more outcomes-oriented performance metrics benefits agencies and enables them to focus on their mission, not on IT.  To adopt a Managed Service delivery model requires a transformational approach that reshapes the delivery and ownership models, this requires a high degree of engagement and customer partnership from an experienced service provider.

Cybersecurity Is More Than Just Compliance,"Compliance is a lagging indicator of a security profile. Cybersecurity is about protecting data at the data level. It's about conducting secure systems engineering with the business need or the mission need in mind and creating architectures that reflect those needs. It involves asking questions like: How do I secure the critical data assets that are vital to the mission and how should I protect them differently than non-critical assets. It also involves a shift in thinking from trusting users and systems within the security perimeter to trusting nothing and no one and focusing on protecting data. The key to all of this is the ability to operate at machine speed, which requires the right people and the right technologies applied in the right places.

CYBER"," In today’s environment, many organizations – across government, academia, and the private sector – make the unfortunate mistake of conflating cybersecurity with cyber compliance. And it’s easy to understand why: There are mountains of guidelines and standards to which these organizations must comply. It’s hard not to be compliance driven. OUR CAPABILITIES OUR CAPABILITIES Learn more about GDIT’s cybersecurity work, including our approach and portfolio. CYBER The difference, while subtle, is important. Compliance is a lagging indicator of a security profile. It takes time to develop standards, gain consensus, share them, implement them, and then update them consistent with operational realities. By the time you do that, the adversary has already figured out the next thing – the thing that’s not included in your compliance standards – while your attention is on checklist management. Compliance protects organizations against legal risk but not against true security risk. When you’re compliance-focused, you’re working toward building compliant systems rather than truly secure ones. “ Compliance protects organizations against legal risk but not against true security risk. When you’re compliance-focused, you’re working toward building compliant systems rather than truly secure ones. ” John Sahlin, Ph.D. John Sahlin, Ph.D. Director, Cyber Solutions – Defense For this reason, organizations must move beyond compliance alone. They must be forward-looking and security-minded, with the understanding that if they are, they’ll inevitably map to compliance. After all, at the end of the day, compliance is table stakes. “Doing things right” is compliance; “doing the right things” is security. So, what does it take to become truly cybersecurity focused? First, a secure cyber approach begins with architecture. It’s about conducting secure systems engineering with the business need or the mission need in mind and creating architectures that reflect those needs. This involves asking questions like: How do I secure the critical data assets that are vital to the mission; what are those assets; and how should I protect them differently than other non-critical assets? Performing this security-minded assessment is key. Having the conversation early means you’re not forced to make those decisions in an ad hoc way in theater. Think about it as if your house were on fire: What’s irreplaceable, what would you grab, where is it? And wouldn’t it be easier to have a go-bag ready rather than making decisions under duress? The second element of a cybersecurity focused approach is resiliency. Once you’ve built a mission-focused technical architecture that maps to critical data assets and functions, your next challenge is not to prevent any possible attack, but to build resiliency. It’s a bit like boxing: You can’t bob and weave around forever; you’ll exhaust all your energy, and you’ll eventually get hit anyway. Instead, good boxers learn to take a hit, bounce back and stay in the fight. A third critical element in cybersecurity: A shift in thinking from trusting users and systems within the security perimeter to trusting nothing and no one and focusing on protecting data. Zero Trust is getting a lot of hype right now, and for good reason. At its core it’s about protecting data at the data level. It’s rooted in an understanding that some data is critical to the mission and, thus, needs to be protected differently. To do it, you might add a layer of security around certain things that you might not add to everything. This is security at a micro level, understanding that a perimeter approach doesn’t work. We have to look at data differently, rather than thinking we can protect the whole system. Of course, the key to all of this is the ability to operate at machine speed, which requires the right people and the right technologies applied in the right places. The average time for a bad actor to move from one segment of a network to another is, on average, 90 minutes. One-third of them can do it in 30 minutes. It’s impossible to expect a human to detect and respond to every potential incident that quickly. So we need technical, automated, real- time solutions that work in concert with human analysts – because the challenge isn’t to identify redline behavior; the challenge lies in reading between the lines. Machine learning and artificial intelligence can easily detect the non-conforming behavior but require human-machine teaming to investigate and interpret the nuance. Together, human analysts help build and train AI/ML models that get smarter over time, and identify adversaries that present – not as needles in haystacks – but as interesting needles among stacks and stacks of needles. This is the approach we take with our clients at GDIT. We work side by side with them to build truly secure environments, rather than just compliant ones, because – again – we know that if you operate with security in mind, you’ll inevitably map to compliance and be ahead of the game at the same time.

Her favorite experience in the program so far has been participating in what’s called Dream Conversations. Each cohort member requests a “dream conversation” with a leader at GDIT and Qun was fortunate enough to have an hour-long conversation with GDIT’s Vice President and Chief Technology Officer. “He shared—without any reservation—how he grew from a pure technical person to a VP and CTO, overseeing a lot of business units within GDIT,” shared Qun. “I learned a lot from him. It’s not just about getting your job done and satisfying the needs on a checklist, but you need to look up, down, right, left, and really think about how to better serve your customer and grow their business.” After that conversation, Qun did just that. When the DAU Vice President approached her about how artificial intelligence could help DAU in the future, Qun not only responded to him, but also connected with the GDIT Center of Excellence to help think through the best AI and machine learning recommendations for the customer. “Before the cohort program, I didn’t know there were such amazing business units supported by the CTO office. We had a conversation with them and they’re going to have a workshop session with my DAU customer.” Learning from peers and leaders The CTC program is helping Qun grow professionally, while also providing greater access to the wider GDIT community. All of which is helping her serve her customer in new and more effective ways. Through monthly cohort activities, Qun is continuously exposed to GDIT leaders and external subject matter experts. Her cohort group includes members from senior management, finance, and other technical professionals. They work through hypothetical problems and situations together. “We share our perspectives and we complement each other’s videpoints, and that really resembles the real world,” Qun shared. “This is an amazing program to broaden my knowledge and skill set.” Her advice for future cohort members? “Try to think out of the box, beyond your current scope or job description, and always think of the bigger picture,” she said. “You never know when your dream might come true.” Qun Zhang, Principal Software Architect, discusses her experience with GDIT's Navy Marine Corp Critical Talent Cohort (NMC CTC or CTC) program.

And as anyone in cybersecurity will tell you, resilience is more than compliance; it’s about agility. Being compliant doesn’t always (and frequently isn’t) the same as being secure, especially as both the nature of cyber threats evolve and the number of tools in cyber adversaries’ arsenals grows. This is why using the flexible Everything as Code (XaC) approach as a means to build resilience into architectures is so important. In fact, OUR CAPABILITIES OUR CAPABILITIES Learn more about GDIT’s cybersecurity work. CYBER building resilience into architectures is actually more important than “just” protecting them – because in a game of prevention, you’ll lose 100 percent of the time. Your adversaries have to be right, or lucky, only once. You have to be right, and lucky, all of the time – forever. Our cybersecurity focus must shift from prevention to resilience – away from the damage control and response model and toward a reality where we architect solutions that enable us to be respond nimbly and quickly, especially as zero-day attacks and exploits increase. You can’t predict or plan for everything, but you have to have a way to respond and bounce forward – not “back,” but forward. You have to continually improve and become as flexible and agile as your adversaries. An XaC approach is the only way to be as flexible as the current cybersecurity landscape demands. With the type of physical security architectures and controls of the past, in order to make a change in response to an emerging threat – even with unlimited budgets or authority – presented lag times from required infrastructure builds or supply chain delays. In today’s environments, you can’t afford to be physical infrastructure driven. If you abstract that into the software space, XaC and a digital engineering approach involves pushing as much of the physical into code as possible. You’ll never be 100 percent there, but the closer you can get, the better. You’ll be better suited to isolate and respond to known threats (or indicators of compromise) as well as anomalies that aren’t yet classified but are of concern. Following the typical “isolate the threat, rapidly respond, and make a change” model, XaC allows for an even more reactive and even more responsive approach because you can deploy faster responses and make quicker changes. And then what is really exciting when we think about cyber resilience – you can start shifting into the world of deceptive cyber operations like tripwires and honeypots. Rather than relying on alarms that tell you when someone is engaged in activities that go against permissions, for example, you can replicate your environment with vulnerabilities that are meant to attract bad actors. From there, you can adapt your actual infrastructure in response to how the criminals interact with your “mirage” one. XaC can help us be more responsive and reactive to infiltrations, enabling us to turn the tables on adversaries and lean into the fight. Many in the cyber world, and beyond, are familiar with the traditional attack frameworks inventory and define the indicators of an attack or compromise. A corollary to that is thinking about a defend framework, wherein, you lay out the hallmarks of resilient infrastructures. Moving forward, organizations need to align to this model, as GDIT is doing as part of our digital engineering approach – just as we’re incorporating things like  Zero Trust , software factory and other solution efforts. Our entire digital engineering approach is moving toward XaC and, of course, we’re also using XaC to enhance the cybersecurity resiliency and the cybersecurity posture of our clients as well as ourselves.  We’re including XaC in our recommendation moving forward and, importantly, our investments in understanding and implementing Zero Trust architectures is core to that effort. The XaC approach allows us to make capability changes quickly and gives us the ability to respond and adapt to adversaries, which is the only way to survive in the cybersecurity domain. You have to evolve, and you have to at least be as flexible as your adversaries. By taking an XaC approach, we can do predictive modeling that drive efficiencies, and we can scenario plan, rather than having the scenario handed to us by our adversaries. And that’s exactly how it should be.  TAGS TAGS CYBER ZERO TRUST  By   John P. Sahlin, Ph.D. John P.

CYBER STACK of actions and location? How much visibility do you have into your own enterprise network and endpoints? Is each system protected against the most current attack vectors? How are you anticipating breaches and how quickly can you respond? It’s rare, unfortunately, for all four of these questions to be answered confidently. But every day at GDIT we work with customers to change that. The hardest thing for many agencies to do once something has been detected is to quickly pivot and make the adjustments necessary to prevent it from happening again. Anticipating breaches and responding quickly GDIT’s proactive approach to next-generation EDR is grounded in the belief that as cyber criminals’ capabilities become more nefarious and more sophisticated, survival is going to increasingly depend on the speed of an organization’s response. “ ...as cyber criminals’ capabilities become more nefarious and more sophisticated, survival is going to increasingly depend on the speed of an organization’s response. ” Johnny Westbank Johnny Westbank Senior Advisor, Technology Consulting The security threat landscape is constantly changing with new verticals and vulnerabilities appearing almost daily. Malicious programs can perform a variety of functions, such as exfiltrating, encrypting, or deleting sensitive data; altering or hijacking core computing functions; command and control; lateral movement; and monitoring users' computer activities for further reconnaissance. Our cyber teams strive  to meet the common 1-10-60 approach, meaning: one minute to detect an attack; ten minutes to fully understand the scope of the attack; and 60 minutes to respond and to contain it. Yet a recent survey of 1,900 senior cyber professionals showed that 95 percent failed to detect attacks within a minute; and it takes the average organization approximately seven days to understand its scope, respond and contain an attack. Creating visibility into attacks Within our  Cyber Stack , we rely on  artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) , and behavior-based and signature-less correlations that enable us to quickly predict where, when, and how cyber-attacks will occur and to block them before they can cause harm. During and following an attack, we create a graphical replay of the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) that occurred so that we can create a visual trail of breadcrumbs showing lateral movements through a network. This enables us to then look at a customer’s entire network – from A to Z – and identify how to improve an agency’s overall security posture. As an enhanced integrator, we also perform API Integration with known vendors in our  Cyber Stack  that accelerate response times, and we use our Security Orchestration Automation and Response (SOAR) capabilities to further accelerate our detection and response times. We deploy enhanced cyber threat intelligence practices and leverage the MITRE ATT&CK and Defend Frameworks to continually improve our ability to anticipate and respond to breaches as well. Our teams also use Automated Vulnerability Management, which requires no scanning overhead and further enhances the speed with which we can secure customer networks and endpoints. Staying ahead of the curve Enhanced cyber threat intelligence and robust EDR capabilities are key elements to any next gen modern cybersecurity strategy. And for good reason. There is a limited and shrinking-all-the-time window in which cyber teams can identify and respond to an attack before serious damage is inflicted. In mission-critical environments across the Federal government, EDR is therefore not just important, it’s essential. This is why the  2021 Executive Order on Cybersecurity  included multiple references to EDR, among them: modernizing and implementing stronger cybersecurity standards in the federal government; improving the detection of cybersecurity incidents on federal government networks; and improving the investigative and remediation capabilities government wide. Moreover, the order called on the United States to lead in government-wide EDR deployments and robust intra-governmental information-sharing. Without question, the Executive Order placed new attention and a redoubled priority on proactive cybersecurity. It aligns with the many agencies’  move to zero trust architectures , within which, next generation EDR capabilities are key. Zero trust requires the use of policies to whitelist and grant access, based on a user’s endpoint device, their credentials, and their behaviors so that authorization and authentication can be continually applied at the device-level and at the user-level for each session. Legacy systems that relied on anti-virus solutions and a “trust but verify” model have failed us.  “Never trust, always verify” is our new mantra : you should never assume trust, but instead continually validate each access request and point to effectively secure users, devices, and data resources. Looking ahead, in a “survival of the fastest” cyber environment, EDR done well enables another layer of finding and correlating information in a way that is accurate and actionable. The organizations with the most enhanced cyber threat intelligence and robust EDR capabilities will be safer, more resilient, and better positioned to adopt continually emerging technologies designed to further strengthen their cybersecurity posture. They’ll be better able to answer my four questions, too.

However, adopting autonomous cyber defense comes with challenges. One of the biggest is the constant increase of threats in the cyber landscape. To ensure that the correct capabilities and technologies are being used to detect unknown threats, agencies need to align people and processes surrounding autonomous cyber defense operations. Using AI and ML, it’s possible to identify and prevent threats through automated analysis sensors, threat indicators, and systems outputs. “ Capabilities such as security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) improves the effectiveness of the cyber workforce as they can focus on more significant events rather than manually investigating trivial events. As cybersecurity processes leverage automation and become continuous, resources can be used more effectively. ” Dr. Matthew McFadden Dr. Matthew McFadden Vice President, Cyber & Distinguished Technologist In addition to specific technologies, autonomous cyber defense should also be applied to use cases such as enhancing perimeter protection, improving endpoint and continuous monitoring, changing misconfiguration, automating patch management, and enriching cyber situational awareness. When agencies focus on increasing agility and strengthening resiliency, it helps prevent more sophisticated cyber-attacks. Roadmap to Zero Trust Automation and orchestration capabilities play a unique role within each pillar of the  Zero Trust Maturity Model , published by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). Here are some ways automation and orchestration influence the five pillars: Identity Identity  – Traditionally, agencies manually verified the identity of a user, sometimes mistaking bad actors as a trusted source. Automation and orchestration can be used to eliminate human error and implement access control technologies, such as AI and ML, to verify identity Device Device  – Similar to the identity pillar, agencies manually managed devices. Automation and orchestration capabilities can provide reactive and dynamic scaling to prevent unauthorized devices from accessing resources Network/Environment Network/Environment  – Agencies initiated and executed network and environment changes following workflows. Autonomous cyber defense can trace IP addresses and locate uncharacteristic patterns in a network Application Workload Application Workload  – In the past, agencies established a central on-premise location to verify a user. Autonomous cyber defense and zero trust verifies the identity of a user both on and off premise Data Data  – Legacy systems lacked consistent organization and labeling, which prevented automation and orchestration. Agencies can schedule audits that allow automation and orchestration to arrange backups of data Trusted Partners Are Here to Help While the progression to adopt autonomous cyber defense is not easy, it is necessary. The Department of Defense’s (DoD)  Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification  (CMMC) has an automation requirement indicating that agencies that leverage automation have more mature cybersecurity systems. The principles of autonomous cyber defense are increasingly being emphasized in various aspects of federal governance, strategy, compliance, modernization of cyber capabilities from zero trust, continuous compliance, DevSecOps, and cloud integration. It’s important for agencies to partner with third parties when undertaking this cyber challenge. Government contractors understand that autonomous cyber technologies are difficult to learn and implement and have a variety of tools to assist agencies to adopt these technologies gradually. For example,  General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT)’s Cyber Stack Solution  helps agencies learn the comprehensive ecosystem of cyber capabilities, addresses the emerging threats changing the cyber landscape, and provides visibility on how to leverage  autonomous cyber and enable zero trust  in their cyber operations. GDIT’s security, orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) tool in Cyber Stack has decreased the workload of manual analytical response by 85 percent. Through the development of playbooks and use cases, GDIT has helped agencies determine high-priority, resource-intensive incidents where autonomous cyber technologies can be used. For example, GDIT’s automation use cases explore cueing and orchestration of defenses and remediation, vulnerability ID and autonomous patching, and adaptive defenses and self-securing systems. A High Stakes Future Autonomous cybersecurity is changing the way agencies protect and secure their critical data. Despite the growing cyber workforce, there are still demands to meet and roadblocks to cross. Government contractors know implementing autonomous cyber can be overwhelming – and that’s why they’re here to help. They support agencies by implementing autonomous cyber defense technologies that address high-priority impacts and free up cyber professionals to focus time on other important work. The increase of cyber attacks is real, and the stakes are high – it’s important, now more than ever, that agencies implement practices to keep themselves, and their data, secure.

OUR CAPABILITIES OUR CAPABILITIES Learn more about GDIT’s application services capabilities. APPLICATION SERVICES 1. Drive mission capabilities and performance DevSecOps enables teams to develop capabilities and features more frequently, with better quality and with more efficiency. It enables key considerations like the diversity of teams and stakeholders, contract requirements, program context, and dynamic policy environments. One example of this is the evolving cybersecurity policy landscape following last year’s Cyber Executive Order and the implementation of its recommendations. DevSecOps promotes the more efficient and effective delivery of solutions and innovations to meet the mission. Together with continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), DevSecOps encourages critical practices like platform operations, product focused development, modern team topologies, agility, minimum viable products (MVPs), canary deployments, feature flags, test automation and more. Taken together, this integrated approach to development drives better performance and widens the aperture of a program’s or an application’s capabilities as well. 2. Improve safety, security, and resilience Another important benefit of DevSecOps is that it establishes guardrails that define and enforce standards and policy. This means developers can turn more of their focus to mission capabilities and the development of mission-grade applications. DevSecOps also increases throughput and change reliability and speed. The deployment of added capabilities and enhancements contributes to greater trust, safety, and security. DevSecOps positions teams to better addresses life-safety critical systems, resilience scalability and performance, cyberthreats, operational needs, and visibility. It promotes practices such as full lifecycle security, Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) practices, infrastructure and configuration as code and more. It results in a smaller software footprint that is easier to deploy and maintain. A DevSecOps approach also supports the creation of software bills of materials (SBOMs), binary and container repositories, policy as code and enhanced monitoring and observability – all things that are essential to a sound and resilient program or application, and conserve critical development resources for innovation in other areas. 3. Enhance the end user experience Without question, DevSecOps enables rapid improvement to the end user experience and overall performance. This is through the accelerated delivery of new and improved capabilities, an intentional focus on the quality of the user experience and increases in productivity and efficiency. It supports a focus on considering all system users and the ways they interact with a system – from end users to the developers, stakeholders, and customer personas. DevSecOps can help teams address things like user awareness, buy-in and adoption – especially with complex and diverse stakeholder environments. When teams incorporate DevSecOps, they build more relevant, more performant mission applications faster. These applications and practices are safer and more resilient. They also result in better performance, improved quality and tailored customer and user experience. This is where the value in the “speed to value” equation comes into play. Our expertise, technology and processes enable us to support the mission; using approaches like DevSecOps enable us to do it faster and in a way that generates true value for our customers. And this is where we start to truly bring “the art of the possible” to our customers and their missions.

DEFENSE"," The modernization of its current and future fleets is a critical priority for the U.S. Navy. GDIT has been supporting the Navy in this continuous mission for nearly a decade, most recently expanding our support to include the Ship and Air Command, Control, Communication, Computers, Combat, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C5ISR) Systems Support (SACSS) contract. Our work on the SACSS program involves performing pier-side ship modernization services that enable the Navy to keep its current vessels operational while it simultaneously adds additional vessels to the fleet. We asked GDIT Vice President  Nancy Graf Nancy Graf  and Ship and Air Integrated Warfare Senior Program Director  Jim Conway Jim Conway , who lead the SACSS program, to talk with us about the work and its strategic importance to the Navy. Here’s what they had to say: OUR INDUSTRIES OUR INDUSTRIES Learn more about our work in Defense. DEFENSE What is the SACSS program? Nancy: Nancy:  Under this contract, GDIT is helping the Navy modernize its ships and increase the readiness of its fleet. We are also supporting other DoD ship and air platforms and systems as well. The Navy wants to have a fleet of more than 350 ships; it’s got about 300 today and ships take years to build and can costs billions of dollars. So, the Navy is working to modernize what it has, and that’s the work we do. We update ship combat systems quickly and efficiently, while the ship is still in the water. Jim: Jim:  That’s right. We’re integrating and installing programs of record. Our work also includes logistics, engineering, program management, but most of what we do is in support of waterfront installation efforts. We're not developing the radar or the guns, as examples, we’re the on-ship installers and the integrators. We do physical hardware infrastructure connections and then we'll do a ship operational verification testing and turn things over to the customer. Sounds like important but complex work. What are some of the unique challenges associated with it? Jim: Jim:  Well, ships move. They’re not like a datacenters or things that are going to be in one place all the time. We have to rapidly react and install these systems of record when – and where – they’re needed. Additionally, we do these installs but we also fabricate. As an example, a sponson is basically a “shelf” on the exterior of a ship that we build and then weld to the side of a ship. They weigh up to 16 tons and they essentially extend the surface of the ship. You can mount weapons systems or other devices on them. So, we hire tradesmen like welders and electricians in addition to technical teams to do our work. Nancy: Nancy:  Another important piece of the puzzle is that all ships, just like aircraft, are scheduled for regular maintenance. But if there is an upgraded combat system that allows you to target better, as an example, or other available system upgrades that increase the ability for warfighters to know more about their targets, sailors shouldn’t have to wait until a ship’s scheduled maintenance for those upgrades. By doing a pier-side modernization, we're able to get that kind of technology on the ships faster and more efficiently and more cost- effectively and also advance national security interests. A lot of us remember the U.S.S. Cole. It was attacked in 2000 by a small boat, and the Cole was badly damaged. The Navy has since deployed the MK-38 gun as a means to increase ship-board self-defense against small boat threats. You can fire it from the bridge and prevent a boat like the one that damaged the Cole from ever getting close. So, that’s an example of why the continuous fleet modernization work that we do at GDIT is important and will continue to be important, and this work supports that. Why was GDIT chosen for this project? Nancy: Nancy:  We brought, with Jim and his team, an expertise and a discipline to the work. We’ve always met requirements and we’ve grown as they’ve grown. We have the people to man the work and get to the ships when we’re needed. We hire from within a robust network and we’re able to react to changing needs and environments. Jim: Jim:  Yes, we’ve been doing ship modification and modernization work with the Navy since 2012, and this most recent SACSS win is an extension and expansion of that work. We know this space; we’ve been working with shipyards to perform various upgrades on rapid timelines, almost like surgical strikes. We have always been very responsive, and very quick to react to a need. With work like this, speed is incredibly important – because it’s all about how quickly you can help protect the ships and the people who are on them. How are we helping the Navy achieve its modernization objectives? Jim: Jim:  We provide expertise, like Nancy said, our team members have been doing this work for several years. It involves hiring people and managing programs efficiently so we can bring customers what they need.  We do lots of upfront planning and Earned Value Management assessments to drive efficiencies and structure wherever we can. Nancy: Nancy:  Exactly - and you can look at it from the company level and from the contract level. As a company, GDIT has the kind of footprint that allows us to support the SACSS program with the tools, facilities and people necessary to meet requirements. At the contract level, we provide this rapid capability to integrate technology into U.S. Navy ships outside of the normal shipyard timelines. The team we have doing it and the support from GDIT at the company level has enabled us to perform, grow the program and to constantly deepen the relationship with the Navy. What’s next for the program? Jim: Jim:  The Navy is always going to be deploying new capabilities and integrating them. Our team will be here to help integrate the next weapons system, the next major upgrade to a class of ship, or other modernizations that will support the warfighter. We’re going to continue to find and develop talent within the trades, which is so important with work like this. We need welders, electricians, fabricators – you can have the best weapons systems in the world but if you can’t get them integrated into the ship, what’s the point? We see so much value in the trades; they’re such a key part of our national defense. Nancy: Nancy:  I agree. We’re six months into a five-year contract and we look forward to supporting the Navy’s ship modernization needs as they evolve. Wherever our ships are in the world, we’ll go there to ensure our service personnel have what they need when they need it.

Corey recalled asking one group of students:  Who wants to be an engineer?  He says, lots of hands went up. Then, when he asked:  Who knows someone who is an engineer?  No hands went up. “I had to correct them,” he said. “You know me. I’m an engineer. Now, you know an engineer.” Corey says that’s precisely the kind of impact he wants to have.  He tells the students how he started as a helpdesk technician, then became a system administrator, then systems engineer, then a program manager. He acknowledges that coding isn’t for everyone, and that’s ok. There’s so much more to STEM beyond software development, and if students can get exposed to STEM activities and get involved in the field now in some way, there will be more open doors for them in the future – whether that involves pursuing higher education, taking a certification course, or joining the military as he did. Corey said he recalled a gentleman who came to speak to his high school class several years ago. The man talked about decision making and how the decisions young people make can have long-term consequences. Corey said this man’s talk had such a huge impact on him that when he was asked to visit classrooms in St. Louis for GDIT, he called the man up to ask for advice. “He cried,” Corey said. “He appreciated me calling and telling him the impact he’d had on me. That’s what I want to do for these kids.” Corey said that while he’s the first GDIT speaker to visit St. Louis classrooms, he knows, based on the questions and feedback he’s gotten from peers, that he won’t be the last.

After all, the ability to efficiently recruit, develop and retain more than 350,000 sailors throughout their careers requires a data environment that supports both descriptive and predictive analytics. Our Approach From that vision, GDIT created ADE 2.0 to serve as the Single Source of Truth for all Navy Enterprise HR Data. The GDIT team employed a commercial, off-the-shelf solution to create the updated ADE. The solution is a multi-domain data lake that consolidates duplicative information repositories into a single warehouse that is secure, stable, and accurate. In total ADE 2.0 enables greater integration and more effective management, while simultaneously increasing security and usability. GDIT also armed the Navy with a state-of-the art tool set that supports data quality and governance that ensures the delivery of authoritative data. ADE 2.0 enables data-driven decisions through analysis and communication with dynamic and interactive dashboards and visualizations. This end-to-end solution has transformed an IT system that was rooted in ancient technology into a modern, data- driven environment, bringing the Navy one step closer to supporting the overarching DoD data strategy, which is to unleash informational assets to advance broader national defense interests. In Action Today, ADE 2.0, now known as the Enterprise Authoritative Data Environment (eADE), is the cornerstone of the Navy transformation effort providing an environment that is modern, scalable, governed, and secure. Moreover, eADE delivers significant savings by reducing the Navy’s overall IT footprint by empowering Navy leaders with the kind of business intelligence and data analytics capabilities they need to predict future HR needs and trends. Lastly, it provides a containerized environment to host and maintain critical enterprise applications, needed by the warfighter, that would otherwise be decommissioned through transformation. We are proud to be a long-standing partner with the U.S. Navy, and to support them on their continued digital modernization journey. The eADE work is just one way we’re doing that and helping the Navy deliver on its mission on the land, on the sea and in the air.

While check-in kiosks have been a travel fixture for years, we must also envision how to create similar self-service options for things like biometrics collection, identity management, declarations and more.

With our experience performing GCS work for more than 20 years and operating in 50 countries globally, we recognize the role that governments and their support partners have in evolving next- generation GCS. Governments must develop a similar understanding of consumer demand, and how “security” now encompasses public health. There are also new information-sharing requirements and the resulting data security considerations associated with handling the sensitive personal health information of travelers. Without question, Covid brought about an openness to change, and simultaneously provided the required downtime to work thoughtfully and intentionally toward that change.

When Your Cyber “Check Engine” Light Is On: IT Ops Is the New Cyber Continuous Monitoring,"As agencies transition to a Risk Management Framework (RMF), understanding cybersecurity issues is more important than ever.

In these checklist-based scenarios, teams run scans, call them good, update their OUR CAPABILITIES OUR CAPABILITIES Learn more about GDIT’s cybersecurity practice. CYBER documentation and move on. This approach is not continuous, and it’s not really “monitoring” either. It’s periodic and based only on how things  should be  in a lab – not what  actually  is based on real-world, as-maintained conditions. It happens in government and private-sector settings all the time. But our adversaries don’t operate like that; they don’t say, “let’s only attack based on a current technical baseline” rather than as capabilities advance or as our environments evolve. The  recent log4j breach is just the latest example of why we must be better at continually looking at IT infrastructure from an operational perspective. Another reason the traditional continuous monitoring approach is problematic: Outside of these tests, most continuous monitoring is alert- based, like a “check engine” light in a car. Does the lack of an alert mean nothing is wrong? What if your alerting capability is broken? What if it’s not even on? “ [M]ost continuous monitoring is alert-based, like a 'check engine' light in a car. Does the lack of an alert mean nothing is wrong? What if your alerting capability is broken? What if it’s not even on? ” John Sahlin, Ph.D. John Sahlin, Ph.D. Director, Cyber Solutions – Defense Extending the analogy, when a “check engine” light comes on, we’re  supposed  to pull over, call a tow truck, find the problem and remedy it immediately. But how often – and for how long – is that light ignored? Do we always immediately stop driving? Of course not. And this happens in cybersecurity too. Once you get an alert, something is already wrong. You’re responding too late. These alerts don’t provide a positive indication of system health and they don’t give you information about the green systems that are trending toward yellow or red but are still in normal operational conditions. These alerts also fail to give us a picture of our risk exposure – how far we can drive with the “check engine” light on to support that critical mission? So, what’s the alternative? Cyber teams should leverage IT Ops to actively assess the true health of production IT systems. GDIT has IT Service Management and Digital Engineering capabilities that we leverage for customers to conduct testing, troubleshooting and analysis on an “as maintained” baseline for systems. This is particularly helpful for distributed networks of networks such as tactical military units, or forward deployed/remote teams. We have also developed an intelligent service management platform for enterprise IT Ops, called Atlas. Atlas can help teams move from pure IT Ops to using data to make better decisions. In tandem, cyber teams must also develop a security health analysis framework for reviewing the IT Ops status and trends and linking both to key RMF security controls. GDIT regularly applies our cybersecurity expertise to design resilience into solutions and, with Atlas, to feed data into security controls. This allows teams to find trends and early indicators of potential problems so they can evaluate overall risk and make decisions as they operate about how to manage or tolerate those risks in the real world, and in real-time. Lastly, cyber teams should use artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide predictive security health assessments. In this model, AI can automate tasks and ML can draw conclusions from the greens in a system (and how to keep them that way) before they get to red. GDIT’s Mission Insights platform uses AI/ML and look at things more holistically. This approach allows teams to prevent issues rather than react to them and  that’s  the real value of true continuous monitoring.  TAGS TAGS CYBER ZERO TRUST  By   John P. Sahlin, Ph.D. John P.

4 Ways 5G Will Disrupt Enterprise IT,"5G is the fifth-generation technology for broadband cellular networks. It will transform IT infrastructures for high-speed, high-performance compute demands. There are four major disruptions that IT leaders should be planning for now to ensure their organizations can capitalize on all that 5G can enable. 5G will usher in new cloud and network paradigms for the enterprise. It has a stronger security baseline than 3G or 4G, and it will be easier to deploy and manage 5G networks.

LEARN MORE need previously only available via ethernet. From my perspective, there are at least four major disruptions that IT leaders should be planning for now to ensure their organizations can capitalize on all that 5G can enable. They are: 1. A New Cloud Paradigm 5G will usher in new cloud and network paradigms for the enterprise. Multi-purpose edge computing (MEC) will become ubiquitous and on-demand, displacing cloud serverless solutions. To support this evolution, 5G will bring in the next generation of cloud computing architectures and force a re-evaluation of current on-premise and cloud-based application architectures. In this way, 5G is also the next generation of cloud – not just the next generation of cellular networks. 2. New Cyber Risks With new opportunity afforded by 5G comes new security risks. But the good news is that 5G has a stronger security baseline than 3G or 4G, or even 4G-LTE, which all had lots of hard tokens and authentication that wasn’t required to be encrypted.  5G will facilitate seamlessly using neutral hosts that operate on and through public and shared infrastructures, which  will make zero trust and end-to-end cyber security solutions  even more essential. Why? Because since you’re virtualizing everything and putting it on generic, x86-based hardware, you have an attack surface that’s wider. Zero trust and additional layers of encryption will make 5G more secure, and will also escalate the need for cyber talent, expertise and tools within an enterprise. Which leads me to my next point… 3. New Work Force In a 5G world, enterprise IT is going to take on a diversity of new skill sets needed to manage and support 5G cellular networks. This includes everything from private standalone 5G LAN deployments for large campus sites to operate through and on, to non-standalone networks that share infrastructure from commercial mobile operators (e.g., Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile). Today, enterprise networks and cellular networks are separate silos. With 5G, it will be easier to deploy and manage 5G networks and the evolution will be just like Wi-Fi – every contract will have a component of it, and integrators like GDIT need to have a workforce in place to capitalize on those opportunities. 4. New Generation of Connected Applications and Associated End user Devices. Finally, 5G will bring in a new wave of applications and end-user devices (and users, for that matter). We’re already seeing the tip of the spear in manufacturing where augmented reality and virtual reality devices are being deployed and connected with Internet of Things and smart devices to drive efficiencies and safety, as examples. The deployment of 5G networks will accelerate the use of devices like this across industries and use cases. For mission support, 5G has exciting potential to help further support the creation of data-centric environments where information is accessible and secure, but also aggregated and applied to users at the edge – such as a single warfighter in combat. Today, GDIT is combining our expertise in  cybersecurity, network and security operations , and  managed services with our expertise in designing networks for enterprise IT  to help optimize our customers’  infrastructure for 5G . As our customers embrace and plan for 5G, we’re leading the way and helping them navigate a powerful and transformative new reality, and ensuring they leverage 5G for all it has to offer.

The Big Picture: A Holistic Approach to Zero Trust,"President Biden released his Cybersecurity Executive Order on May 12, 2021. It requires agencies to move to secure cloud services and a zero-trust architecture, while mandating deployment of multi-factor authentication and encryption. The Office of Management and Budget and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency recently published its finalized strategy and roadmaps for agencies to transition to zero trust models over the next two years.

CYBER As organizations have increasingly moved to the cloud and workforces have become more dispersed – particularly over the last two years – people use various devices in numerous locations to access resources inside and outside the enterprise network. The traditional perimeter has dissolved; the user is the new perimeter, and cybersecurity practices must evolve to keep pace. A New Direction for Federal Cybersecurity On May 12, 2021, President Biden released his Cybersecurity Executive Order, a wide-reaching document covering numerous areas from improving threat information sharing and supply chain security to furthering detection and response capabilities. The order requires agencies to move to secure cloud services and a zero-trust architecture, while mandating deployment of multi-factor authentication and encryption. This makes zero-trust architecture the cyber strategy that will carry our industry into the future, guiding the capabilities, processes, and cyber investments across the entire government. In addition, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)  recently published its finalized strategy and roadmaps for agencies to transition to zero-trust models  over the next two years, as well as securely migrate to cloud services. For many agencies, the biggest question is “where do we begin?” The models from OMB and CISA give agencies a good starting point, helping them set immediate priorities to make positive and substantial change, one step at a time. It’s important to recognize that while this is a massive culture and mindset change for many organizations, transitioning to a zero-trust model will help agencies realize significant benefits – including improved enterprise-wide visibility, simplified IT management, remote workforce protection, a more streamlined user experience, and a data informed defense. A Holistic Approach to Zero Trust While the benefits are clear, many agencies may not have holistic, enterprise-wide cyber capabilities, or they may lack key visibility between them. They may face workforce gaps that make it difficult to make the required mindset shift around zero-trust principles. Most are managing multi-cloud environments but may not have a solid grasp on what data they have, where it resides, and how its flowing between environments and key business partners. And there are still a lot of agency applications residing on legacy, mainframe, or operational technology – upping the ante on cybersecurity complexity and modernization challenges. Agencies do not have to travel this road alone. They can – and should – work with a trusted technology partner that has the experience, scalability, and holistic approach needed to help them navigate the zero-trust journey. “ Agencies do not have to travel this road alone. They can – and should – work with a trusted technology partner that has the experience, scalability, and holistic approach needed to help them navigate the zero- trust journey. ” Michael Baker Michael Baker Vice President and Chief Information Security Officer At GDIT,  we have worked closely with our Federal customers to adopt the principles of zero trust  long before the release of the Executive Order. With more than 3,000 cyber professionals and a partner ecosystem of more than 30 cyber alliances, we bring the most innovative capabilities to the table to address our customers’ toughest cyber challenges.  Our defined Cyber Stack  maps closely to the zero-trust pillars of identity, device, network, application, and data. We work with our customers every step of the way, helping them define their goals and objectives, map data flows, identify the high value assets, and apply the right set of technologies to enable the adoption or maturation of capabilities supporting zero trust principles. As agencies reach a certain level of maturity in their zero-trust journeys, automation should be a key investment priority.  Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) tools can help organizations understand what “normal” behavior looks like in their environment, identify abnormal behavior in real-time, and restrict access until further investigation can occur. GDIT is taking this even farther by increasing the adoption of AI/ML to detect threats and increase automation through the adoption of advanced Endpoint Detect and Response (EDR) and Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) capabilities. This allows us to develop standard automated playbooks that improve detection and response so our customers’ cyber teams can focus on prioritized events. By adopting zero-trust strategies, agencies can increase resiliency to prevent many threats before they happen or react at machine speed when they do. Identity as the Foundation Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM)  are foundational to a successful zero-trust strategy. Organizations must have a strong understanding of their users and system accounts and enforce policies that define who/what should have access to specific applications and resources each time it is requested. GDIT is currently working with government agencies to build an  identity, credential, and access management (ICAM) program , a federated identity service that will help mitigate inefficiencies, facilitate strong authentication to cloud services, provide authorization services with role-based access, and enable better and faster audits of users and resources. Securing identity is a critical cybersecurity strategy in the push toward a zero-trust architecture. GDIT is supporting multiple defense and civilian agencies on their zero-trust journeys. And, of course, we are our first customer. At GDIT, we’re accelerating our own zero-trust journey, while recognizing that zero trust is a continuous evolution rather than a process with a final endpoint. We are focused on applying zero-trust concepts across our enterprise environment as we mature governance needed to manage our architecture moving forward. Looking Ahead As cyber threats continue to grow in frequency and sophistication, agencies must make the shift to a zero-trust architecture to protect their systems, data, and users. There is no alternative; this is the future around how we should be prioritizing strategy and investments. While making this shift is and will continue to be challenging, zero trust will ultimately pay huge dividends – enabling broader digital transformation, helping government agencies deliver on their mission, and making it easier and more secure for their users to work productively and safely on any device, from anywhere. The time to get started is now, and agencies do not need to fly solo. They should lean in with trusted technology partners who can share their experience, methods, and common pitfalls to take a holistic approach to zero trust and drive to real outcomes. At GDIT, we are honored to work with our customers as they make this important shift to improve our nation’s cybersecurity and deliver on their mission.

CLOUD System (DDPS) that would process all Medicare covered and non-covered prescription drug events (PDEs) and related data about them. This data is important because it is used to validate and authenticate billions of dollars of Medicare payments for prescription drugs. Additionally, GDIT was chosen to develop the Payment Reconciliation System (PRS), which is a companion system to DDPS that compares prospective drug payment information to actual costs to perform various types of payment reconciliations. Over the last decade while performing this critical work, GDIT has established itself as a trusted partner to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which administers the Medicare program and oversees the DDPS and PRS. Our teams have been instrumental in helping the agency on a host of modernization initiatives. The most recent modernization effort began in 2016, when the GDIT team observed a 37% increase in incoming PDE volume from 2012 to 2015. This coincided with a growing number of system contention and bottleneck issues on the mainframe. The GDIT team began exploring innovative solutions to address these issues. This included Hadoop and AWS Redshift proofs of concept (POCs) along with an accompanying white paper, which captured the results.  Eventually, the GDIT team, in consultation with the CMS/DDPS leadership team, selected the CMS AWS Cloud services as the most efficient and cost-effective solution. The GDIT team worked with CMS to develop and implement a three-phased mainframe-to-AWS migration approach designed to minimize risk as well as impacts to stakeholders. As part of this effort, the GDIT team also took on the challenge to start its DevSecOps pipeline and transition from waterfall to the SAFe Agile methodology. Throughout the phases, the team matured its DevSecOps and SAFe Agile processes, ensuring a smooth and timely migration. At every step of the way, the GDIT team collaborated with CMS and continued to conduct other POCs to assess the efficacy of new cloud-based tools and technologies (e.g., Databricks, AWS Lambda, SonarQube, and Jenkins). In addition, throughout this large-scale effort, the team shared its acquired knowledge, lessons learned, and best practices with CMS and other Medicare Enrollment Payment Systems (MEPS) contractors, to assist them in their own migration efforts. In June 2021, GDIT successfully completed the migration project on time and on budget. Key highlights of the effort are as follows: This was the first AWS migration among the many MEPS programs, which allowed DDPS to lead the way on several fronts, including Agile, DevSecOps, and Cloud application development. After the full migration, DDPS realized a 35 percent reduction in overall storage requirements and a ~60 percent reduction in PDE processing run time. Other notable improvements include an 82% savings in National Drug Code (NDC) Cycle processing time and a ~20% reduction in the time required for operational tasks associated with month-end reports. PRS was the most recently migrated system. Based on the results from integration testing, performance for PRS is expected to improve by 50%. We delivered costs savings through auto-scaling and auto-termination in workloads and by utilizing spot instances to reduce EC2 instance costs. This implementation has added more system capabilities allowing the GDIT team to perform advanced data analytics using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning efficiently and cost-effectively. Together with CMS leaders, the GDIT team planned and executed the migration with no business operations impact and had zero moderate or high-severity-level defects post implementation. After the very first phase of the project, we were able to eliminate significant mainframe system contention issues, thereby addressing our biggest problems first. This project is one example of how GDIT regularly partners with clients to develop a vision, define a roadmap, and bring it to life strategically and tactically. Collaboration was key throughout the effort and extended beyond our teams and customers to other contractors in the MEPS group. This led to perfect CPAR scores from CMS and increased, enhanced ability for CMS to deliver on its mission for millions of Americans who rely on the Medicare for their prescription medications. We were proud to support CMS on this important endeavor and look forward to ensuring its cloud objectives remain achievable, beneficial, and expertly executed.

OUR CAPABILITIES OUR CAPABILITIES See how GDIT is applying AI to advance agency missions. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE As a standard practice, creating digital twins and then constantly running simulations would mean processes and teams would become consistently more and more efficient, and the impacts would compound over time. GDIT is working with customers today on digital twin initiatives that involve making processes work better, so agencies can work better. Testing process automations with AI and RPA A digital twin allows you run as many simulations you like without risk or adding costs to testing. Not only can you see areas for improvement of your processes, but you can test out process optimizations that use AI and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to ensure that any proposed change actually provides value. As one vendor puts it, “using RPA bots helps to take the robot out of the human”. And that’s entirely true: humans are critical thinkers and are better served performing those types of activities, instead of clicking a virtual button over and over again. Smart automation provides the mechanism to make your process faster, more efficient and less prone to human error, while also freeing up staff time so that they can focus on higher value order tasks. Simulations and data provide results-oriented decision- making When you think more broadly about the impact of digital twins, let’s consider these questions:  If you had a dollar to spend on automation in your agency, where would you spend it? Why? How do you know what kind of impact it would have? And if you had visibility into all the processes going on in your agency – and how they really worked, at a granular level – would you feel better about where to deploy that dollar?  Of course you would. One area within agencies where lots of process-driven work happens is talent. Whether you’re hiring, training or retaining talent, there’s a huge data management component, a lot of compliance to track, and so on. Any HR manager will tell you that a lot of their day is spent following processes that could use additional speed, efficiency, or risk reduction – all the things digital twins bring to the table. And any IT manager will tell you that deploying technology with demonstrable, quantifiable value is one way they add value to the organization. So, when you, the decision maker, are presented with an opportunity to deploy dollars in precisely that way, where will you do it? How will you make your decision? One would argue that without the certainty of a process simulation, you’re not “deciding” at all. You’re assuming. And you’re assuming an impact with no assurances of results. The term “data driven decisions” is popular to the point of becoming a cliché; but what if the decision itself was made by digital simulations that showed exactly what the impact of certain decisions would be. Wouldn’t that be better than just using data? It could harness both data and simulation which would provide digitally determined, results-oriented decision making. This is how you make decisions that are actually about deciding between two (or three or four or ten) things, versus making a decision and hoping for the best. Digital twins optimize knowledge management and procurement Using digital twins for process management and optimization is especially important right now in the federal space, as attrition remains a real problem. People are choosing to leave their agency posts for other geographic locations or for private sector jobs or choosing to retire altogether. In large part, these are people who know how government works. Digital twins can help capture that knowledge and close gaps with new hires. Digital twins can also help when it comes to procurement. The Amazon shopping experience that we all know and love is an easy, seamless process – from browsing to checking out. That didn’t happen by accident. Imagine if the federal government’s procurement of services happened in a much more similar way, with standard approvals that are automated and expedited, saving time and money and delivering on missions faster.

LEARN MORE," OUR CAPABILITIES OUR CAPABILITIES GDIT’s Federal logistics and supply chain management services help keep Federal supply chains – and the American people – secure. LEARN MORE Modern supply chain engineering and logistics can be traced back to WWII, when the U.S. government developed a system to get supplies and equipment to troops spread throughout the world quickly and efficiently. Supply chain engineering and logistics have drastically changed since, in large part thanks to E-commerce, the need for more supplies in offices, and the rapid growth of purchase order transactions. Because of these factors, consumers have become more vulnerable to data risks. Vulnerabilities to data risks have led bad actors to pounce on weak links along the complicated supply chain. These bad actors have had long-term effects on both corporations and government entities – with recent attacks racking up  nearly $100 billion in repairs . It’s imperative users constantly check risks associated with their supply chain. Without constant monitoring, entities can be left exposed. To prevent exposure to bad actors, agencies must plan ahead and be aware of possible disruptions to the supply chain. One way to plan ahead is to build a strong relationship with your supplier – it’s crucial to do this before supply chain issues start. If you know how your supplier operates, who they interact with, who they deliver to, and what their business practices are – you are more likely to have more visibility into potential threats. By exposing risk earlier, entities can make sure they are taking the correct steps in their supply chain risk management approaches. “ If you know how your supplier operates, who they interact with, who they deliver to, and what their business practices are – you are more likely to have more visibility into potential threats. ” Alex McGuire Alex McGuire Supply Chain Officer As previously mentioned, technology and E-commerce play a huge role in the increase of cyber threats in the supply chain – making it almost impossible to secure the supply chain manually. However, agencies can take advantage of certain technology to eliminate future supply chain risks and cyber attacks. Innovative technologies are needed for efficiency and access to real-time data. For example, artificial intelligence provides users the opportunity to look deeper into their supply chain, and their supplier’s corporate structure – exposing risk earlier. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed the fragility of the supply chain. It’s apparent now, more than ever, that issues in one part of the chain can create a domino effect of disruption that include empty store shelves, higher prices for raw materials, and a shortage of microchips that shut down automotive plants. This exposed fragility has gotten the attention of the highest levels of government. The Department of Defense’s  Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC), being developed now , combines cybersecurity standards and best practices to all cybersecurity levels. If agencies are committed to cybersecurity practice, and the reporting and sharing of cyberthreat intelligence, they must follow the CMMC’s standards and procedures. CMMC is just one piece of the multifaceted solution to keeping a secure supply chain. Every department in every entity plays a role in keeping the supply chain secure. For example, the finance department’s role in assessing financial risks is just as important as the IT department’s role in assessing cyber risk. While technology is important to leverage, having a human element is equally important. As entities continue to operate outside of their borders and risks to supply chains increase, they must rely on third parties for help. President Biden’s  Cyber Executive Order  includes a full section on how to improve supply chain security. GDIT’s supply chain risk management framework identifies and mitigates risks, including cyber security risk, through a comprehensive suite of polices, procedures, and tools that ensures a risk-based approach to supply chain: vetting suppliers and subcontractors for risk prior to point of procurement and enabling appropriate monitoring and preventive action throughout the supplier life cycle. GDIT taps into emerging technology solutions to provide end-to-end supply chain visibility. As one of the largest supply chains in the Federal government, GDIT supports supply chain management services that deliver large quantities of mission-critical assets around the globe with their expertise and experience. We provide the support agencies need to predict and mitigate risk, and if needed the removal of suppliers and software when threat actors are detected, to ensure mission objectives are achieved at scale for government clients.

LEARN MORE To manage these risks, a holistic approach should be taken. At GDIT, we look at the tools, technologies, training and protocols that need to be in place to ensure our stakeholders/supplier base are best positioned to minimize, find and mitigate risk. We constantly evolve our approach to stay one step ahead, and then use those lessons learned on program to benefit our federal agency customers. Customer zero: First consumer of SCRM approach We think of ourselves as “customer zero,” meaning that we’re the first consumer of our own Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) approach. This allows us to see what works well and to drive innovation and quality enhancements for our customers. As a result, we’ve put into place things like a rapid risk rating metric, a scorecard for assessing a monitoring for concerns, and a supply chain risk assessment (SCRA) that continuously monitors our supplier base. others. The recent  Executive Order  on cybersecurity calls for new criteria to evaluate the security practices of software developers and suppliers, and for the development of new tools to demonstrate conformance with secure practices. This is the kind of constant improvement and knowledge sharing that we work to deliver every day. Our team monitors for opportunities for improvement and ensures our readiness to act on them. We have established appropriate corporate governance and recognize that, in our organization, everyone has a role to play. Ready to respond to risk events If a cybersecurity event occurred in which data was inappropriately accessed and becomes vulnerable a response across the organization, from technologists, compliance, legal and operations, is required. The channels to bring those subject matter experts together and the protocols for addressing issues must be in place well before an event. We know we can’t win SCRM from behind a desk. Therefore, the engagement across teams is so critical. GDIT stood up a centralized, dedicated team to improve our SCRM effort, along with a centralized platform through which teams from across the business could raise issues and assess and address their impact. As part of this work, my team identified more than 60 risk items – from cybersecurity to legal to compliance to operations – and heat- mapped and prioritized each item. We have plans to address the risk, and today, continually evolve both the plans and the list itself as new potential issues emerge. Another area we monitor is supplier relationships. Supplier assessments occur every 90-days – not just at the beginning of a new period of performance. This has created an environment where risk management is top of mind and where plans exist to address risk in all its forms. For us, the quiet noise is success. When we do our jobs well and there are no issues, we’ve won. We can take our approach to our customers and their programs, and they can trust us to perform.

CYBER," OUR CAPABILITIES OUR CAPABILITIES Learn more about GDIT’s cybersecurity practice and the work we do to secure the critical missions of our customers. CYBER The release of President Biden’s Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity signaled the importance of cybersecurity as a critical national security priority. And for good reason. Over the last year, the SolarWinds breach, the Colonial Pipeline ransomware event that led to panic-induced gas shortages on the east coast, and a constant cadence of retailer data breaches have kept cybersecurity issues top of mind for American consumers. But the reality is cybersecurity requires constant attention and evolution, and while this Executive Order is a major step in the right direction, the onus is on companies like GDIT to help put technologies and practices into place that keep our clients’ information, infrastructures, and missions secure. As we kick off Cybersecurity Awareness Month, we sat down with two leaders within the GDIT Cybersecurity practice – Mike Baker, Chief Information Security Officer and Dr. Matthew McFadden, Vice President, Cyber and Distinguished Cyber Technologist – to get their thoughts on the Executive Order, the latest news on cyber funding, and recent guidance on  zero trust  from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Cybersecurity Infrastructure and Security Agency (CISA). What does the Executive Order mean for government contractors? Mike Baker: Mike Baker:  The Cyber EO sets the right tone for federal civilian agencies and those who serve them that sound cyber hygiene and practices are and will be a top priority for our nation moving forward. One of the unifying themes across the order is the standardization of cyber practices across agencies – this includes migration to secure cloud solutions, zero trust adoption, multi-factor authentication use, cyber threat intelligence sharing, endpoint security, logging, and incident response. It is up to government contractors to not only support agencies with this mission but to meet or exceed the requirements within the EO. There is a clear sense of direction and urgency that raises the bar across our entire industry and supplier ecosystem. Matt McFadden: Matt McFadden:  Government contractors like GDIT must make it easier to effectively implement consistent and mature cybersecurity practices that increase resiliency, as well as leverage advanced capabilities that further protect our federal customers. The EO recognizes the importance of relationships between the public and private sectors to increase collaboration so we can align cybersecurity investments with risks to minimize incidents. What does it mean for GDIT? Baker: Baker:  This EO will be a driving force behind many initiatives for years to come at GDIT as we continue to lean in on the tenants it outlines. Based on our diverse federal customer set, GDIT has been executing many of the processes outlined in the order for some time now. Key among those is our commitment to cyber threat intelligence sharing and reporting. We’ve had a multi-year journey to operationalize and apply cyber threat intelligence, automation, and incident response across our networks. We have significant experience both internally and across our customer base in secure migration to cloud services, zero trust, incident response, and endpoint protection. This order does come with some challenges – namely the specifics around software supply chain security and its effects on our key software partners. These requirements will change the way we provide solutions to the federal government and the manner in which GDIT and our partners are required to demonstrate secure development practices, source code testing, and delivery of a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM). In addition, the mandate for standard cybersecurity requirements across the entire government will require us to be agile, as we are in our ongoing response to the DoD’s Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) program. “ The EO will help us drive successful cyber transformation, backed by executive direction, common standards, and budgets.  ” Dr. Matthew McFadden Dr. Matthew McFadden GDIT Vice President, Cyber and Distinguished Cyber Technologist As a Federal Systems Integrator, we have significant insight and experience in cybersecurity modernization across federal networks. We have the unique ability to share those lessons learned and best practices, so we can drive efficiencies and effectiveness as we work with each customer. While the EO is new, GDIT has been at the forefront of many of these critical efforts – like zero trust, secure software supply chain, DevSecOps, and endpoint detection and response (EDR) – in our support of our government customers over the last several years. What actions are we taking as a result? Baker: Baker:  We continue to evaluate the impact and opportunities this order will have on GDIT. We’re accelerating our zero trust journey, while recognizing that zero trust is an evolution rather than a destination. Using the tenants of zero trust along with our risk management principles to define our capability roadmap over the short, medium, and long term will provide great benefits for our continued defense. We are also laser focused on evolving our Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) practices to address risk by actively engaging our supplier ecosystem to discuss the requirements early and often, including GDIT’s expectations around compliance. This includes building secure software development frameworks, secure coding, and a software bill of materials (SBOM) before regulatory action is implemented. All these elements will be critical moving forward in servicing both our company and customers. McFadden: McFadden:  GDIT continues to expand our capabilities and solutions, focused on modernizing and implementing stronger cybersecurity standards/capabilities. For example, we are using Secure Cloud Services with Cloud-Native cybersecurity capabilities as we bring robust solutions – in conjunction with our best-of-breed partners – to help agencies adopt zero trust architecture across each pillar – Identity, Device, Network, Application/Workload, and Data. We’re taking this even farther by increasing the adoption of AI/ML to detect threats and increase automation through the adoption of Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR). This allows us to create standard automated playbooks that improve detection and response so our customers’ cyber workforce can focus on prioritized events. By adopting zero trust strategies, agencies can increase resiliency to prevent many threats before they happen. How will the Executive Order impact Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) work? Baker: Baker:  It will have a large impact in the software procurement realm. GDIT is already implementing lessons learned across industry around the SolarWinds event in late 2020. The EO assists these efforts as it creates a mandate across government and the software supplier ecosystem. It will also lead to a Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) update sometime in 2022 that all companies will need to prepare for well in advance. GDIT does a great job performing cyber risk assessments on all purchases along with assessing cyber hygiene risk across key suppliers and subcontractors on a continuous basis. Our focus moving through the rest of this year is on working with our partners to determine how we can deliver key attributes of a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) in accordance with the EO. That along with continuing to focus on improved illumination and provenance across our supply chain to deeper tiers will bring us even more assurance around the software and hardware products we leverage internally and/or purchase on behalf of our customers. McFadden: McFadden:  The EO will require us to have more stringent cybersecurity partnerships that meet increased assurance levels. We are also implementing processes to increase supply chain analysis. For example, we are embracing DevSecOps and validating software continuously before it goes into production, using static and dynamic code analysis, as well as implementing more robust threat detection and continuous compliance. What does it mean for things like zero trust architectures? Baker: Baker:  This order is the exclamation point that makes zero trust architecture the cyber strategy that will carry us into the future, guiding the capabilities, processes, and investments across the entire government. OMB and CISA recently published draft guidance documents that provide roadmaps for agencies to transition to zero trust models over the next three years, as well as securely migrate to cloud services. For a lot of agencies, the biggest question is “where do we begin?” And the models from OMB and CISA give agencies a really good starting point as they start to think about how to evolve their environments to a zero trust model. These guidelines help set immediate priorities to make positive and substantial change, one step at a time, along a zero trust journey. “ At GDIT, we’re applying these principles to our own network to determine where we can make improvements in the short, medium, and long term. ” Mike Baker Mike Baker GDIT Chief Information Security Officer We are focused on applying zero trust concepts across users, data, and workloads, as we stand up the needed governance to manage the architecture moving forward. While this will inform our cyber investments in the coming years, we are also in the process of updating our policies and core control requirements across our networks to fully embrace our immediate zero trust objectives. McFadden: McFadden:  As Mike said, the EO – along with the guidance from OMB and CISA – provide solid support to agencies as they begin their journeys. And it was also great to see that the government is backing up this critical priority with funding – the Technology Modernization Fund (TMF) Board just announced seven new awards totaling $311 million to fund agency investments in zero trust networking and digital identity, secure data and information sharing, and improved interagency collaboration. We are working hard to embrace the Cyber EO and assist agencies with alignment with the goals of the Federal Zero Trust strategy. As agencies move forward, they must apply a holistic perspective to zero trust; it’s not just about a single pillar implementation, for instance, network segmentation. Zero-trust is a strategy requiring extensive stakeholder participation and business governance for implementation. GDIT has been working with numerous agencies to assist them with their transformation roadmaps to adopt a zero trust architecture. We work with our customers every step of the way, helping them define their protect surface, map transaction flows, identify the highest value implementation assets, and apply the right set of technologies to enable holistic adoption of zero trust. What about data security and privacy? Baker: Baker:  The necessary evolution of data security is well documented in the EO, which requires data categorization for sensitive but unclassified data across all federal government agencies. This reflects some of the progress made over the last few years with the Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) program that drives our Department of Defense (DOD) CMMC compliance framework. An expansion of the application of this program will also drive needed requirements – namely encryption in transit and at rest for this data, along with mandatory multi-factor authentication. At GDIT, we have taken a “data first” approach for some time, and we continue to invest heavily in programs to support the continued protection of GDIT and customer data across on premise and cloud platforms. In doing so, we can categorize all data on our network, apply controls where required, and ultimately extend data protection outside our boundary using digital rights management. McFadden: McFadden:  Zero-trust will help transform and enable data security as you must determine what data you have, where it resides, and where it flows to protect it. GDIT supports our customers in this area by increasing use of cloud services to accelerate zero trust by using secure infrastructure with zero trust capabilities built-in. What should customers know about the Executive Order? Baker: Baker:  Customers should know that the timelines outlined in the EO are extremely ambitious and they should start preparing now. The requirements represent a monumental shift across how government networks are secured, software is procured, and cyber teams operate and collaborate with partners. GDIT has significant experience in many of these areas, and we can share our methods and common pitfalls we have encountered. My advice is to take action now and lean in with companies like GDIT to collaborate and drive to the much-needed outcomes required by the order. McFadden: McFadden:  GDIT has significant experience working through every aspect of the EO and we increasingly share our experience, knowledge, and lessons learned through our Cyber Center of Excellence to help our customers and partners overcome many common challenges. We have more than 3,000 cybersecurity professionals, we support cybersecurity across most federal agencies, and we have more than 30 unique cyber alliances, enabling us to apply the most innovative capabilities and offerings to our customers’ biggest challenges – including transforming and enhancing their cybersecurity programs to meet the EO requirements. Is there anything else you want to add? Baker: Baker:  There is more to this order that we didn’t touch on today, such as the formation of a Cyber Safety Review Board and a more detailed dive into potential FAR changes that could affect contracts moving forward. We have yet to see how these mandates could materialize and become operational, but one thing is clear. Sound cyber hygiene and security by design within the software we consume is rightfully a top priority across federal government to protect our nation’s most sensitive data. GDIT looks forward to embracing the changes in our own enterprise, along with helping our customers in the achievement of this critical mission. McFadden: McFadden:  Meeting the EO requirements is a journey, and no journey is completed instantaneously. It requires hard work, prioritizing resources, establishing baselines, and making incremental improvements over time. Through GDIT’s knowledge, collaboration with various agencies/partners, and implementation of modernized cyber technologies, we know we can help agencies get there faster.

Modernization in a DoD context involves leveraging new technical capabilities, achieving enhanced operations, and functioning more efficiently as an agency. Strategies aimed at achieving these goals are directed from the center and include policy, standards, and guidance, yet they are executed in a distributed fashion across agencies and subagencies. As each service branch builds its own incremental components, an unintentional result is the creation of siloed implementations. We’re seeing it today across everything from  cloud  to  cyber  and  zero trust . Dan Schaaf, GDIT’s Senior Solutions Director and Army Sector CTO recently  made the case  for establishing an interoperable, zero trust foundation for JADC2, the Joint All-Domain Command and Control initiative, which involves connecting all sensors from across all branches of the military into a single network. Schaaf talked about the risk of relying on separate and incompatible information networks, and pointed to three areas of opportunity that mission partners like GDIT can help solve: First, navigating the many zero trust products and capabilities on the market; second, integrating with existing capabilities and investments; and third, establishing an enterprise foundation that includes a cloud instantiation that can house and federate a set of required core capabilities. To that end, Jim Matney, Vice President and General Manager of the DISA and Enterprise Services Sector for GDIT’s Defense Division, recently explained  the progress made in recent years toward cloud adoption more broadly at the DoD and the challenges it has faced along the way. “ It’s more than just migrating the application into the cloud. Your infrastructure must have the ability to enable users to access and leverage those applications. ” Jim Matney Jim Matney"," As one might expect, the Department of Defense is continually modernizing to meet the needs of the warfighter. Modernization in a DoD context involves leveraging new technical capabilities, achieving enhanced operations, and functioning more efficiently as an agency. Strategies aimed at achieving these goals are directed from the center and include policy, standards, and guidance, yet they are executed in a distributed fashion across agencies and subagencies. As each service branch builds its own incremental components, an unintentional result is the creation of siloed implementations. We’re seeing it today across everything from  cloud  to  cyber  and  zero trust .

It also  meets DOD Impact Level 5 security ratings (soon to be IL-6 certified), and is readily accessible by all DOD components and authorized DOD partners. Together, zero trust and cloud are enabling technologies that give DoD an enhanced ability to protect any resource, anywhere and at any time. And just as importantly, they will accelerate warfighter capabilities by ensuring data from sensors, users and applications operating on and across JADC2 can be trusted and be used more universally. As DoD leaders have acknowledged, future conflicts will require future leaders to make decisions within minutes, or even seconds. The JADC2 concept is integral to delivering that critical ability. ® TAGS TAGS CLOUD DEFENSE ZERO TRUST  Related 51 MIN WATCH CLOUD,  CYBER,  DEFENSE,  DEE Enabling JADC2: How Digital Engineering Reduces Risk 3 MIN READ INTELLIGENCE,  HOMELAND SECURITY,  CLOUD 5 Data Center Best Practices That Have Nothing To Do With 5 Data Center Best Practices That Have Nothing To Do With Technology 51 MIN WATCH CLOUD,  CYBER,  DEFENSE,  AIR FORCE AND SPACE FORCE,  MPE Enabling JADC2: MPE and the Integration of Mission Partners at the Tactical Level 52 MIN WATCH CLOUD,  CYBER,  DEFENSE,  AIR FORCE AND SPACE FORCE Enabling JADC2: How ICAM is Advancing Information Sharing "

On an annual basis, we recognize employees who have logged 100+ hours of volunteerism in the calendar year, along with four employees who logged 250+ hours of volunteerism. The latter are chosen via a blind survey by business leaders. This year, we recognized 12 exceptional and impactful GDIT volunteers, along with announcing our four 2020 Volunteers of the Year. Back to School Supply Drive Every year, as students prepared for back-to-school season, GDIT partners with Title I schools and organizations that support low-income or underserved communities. Together, we hold a school supply drive, but this year our support looked a little different. We utilized a hybrid support model that blended in-person activities with an online digital component. This meant we could maintain our support for these partners and expand employee engagement to include remote employees. On-site collections were available for employees reporting to a GDIT site. And the model worked! In total, we collected more than 18,000 school supplies across 23 locations and distributed them to 26 schools and organizations. “ Thank you for choosing Southwestern Elementary as one of your community partners. On behalf of our entire school family, thank you for your donations to our scholars. Your contributions of school supply kits provided the means for students to start the year with all of the essential tools.

Four Considerations for Moving to the Cloud,"Agencies are moving to the cloud. GDIT offers advice on how to make the transition to cloud a success. They need to understand why they're moving to cloud, governance and leverage the tools that exist today to protect against building silos. Agencies should be sure that the introduction of a new cloud platform doesn't result in siloed workstreams or intractable procedural hurdles. The cloud is about expanding capabilities, doing more, handling more workloads, and becoming more flexible. It's important to surround your cloud endeavors with the operational resources and support necessary to take advantage of all the benefits the cloud has to offer. Cloud vendors are constantly evolving and deploying new services and capabilities that could help solve some of your agency’s toughest challenges.","TAGS TAGS CLOUD  By   Patrick Ruhe Patrick Ruhe Defense Cloud Capability Lead Related 51 MIN WATCH CLOUD,  CYBER,  DEFENSE,  DEE Enabling JADC2: How Digital Engineering Reduces Risk 3 MIN READ INTELLIGENCE,  HOMELAND SECURITY,  CLOUD 5 Data Center Best Practices That Have Nothing To Do With Technology 51 MIN WATCH CLOUD,  CYBER,  DEFENSE,  AIR FORCE AND SPACE FORCE,  MPE Enabling JADC2: MPE and the Integration of Mission Partners at the Tactical Level 52 MIN WATCH CLOUD,  CYBER,  DEFENSE,  AIR FORCE AND SPACE FORCE Enabling JADC2: How ICAM is Advancing Information SharingTo put it in simple terms, I’d like to highlight three things you need to consider for a multi-cloud strategy: an understanding of  why  you’re moving to the cloud, governance, and an approach to leverage the tools that exist today to protect against building silos.

OUR CAPABILITIES OUR CAPABILITIES Learn more about GDIT’s cloud capabilities. CLOUD These steps can help organizations avoid mistakes that can cost them time and money and put them on the right track to truly leverage cloud (and the people who know how to work effectively within it) for the good of their missions. Here are some important considerations that will help make moving to the cloud a success. 1. Remember Cloud Computing Is a Mission Enabler Far too often the cloud is viewed as a “place to be” and not a capability. Even if you’re lifting and shifting applications into the cloud, you still have to adjust your operations and platforms so that you can support your cloud environment – one that, in reality, is likely going to include or evolve to multiple clouds. It’s therefore critical to surround your cloud endeavors with the operational resources and support necessary to take advantage of all the benefits the cloud has to offer. Treat cloud as a mission enabler to enhance your core capabilities, and you start to see all the components necessary to ensure you are leveraging cloud to its fullest potential for your agency. 2. Go Multi-Cloud Only if It’s Right for You The cloud by itself has lots of benefits to offer: it’s elastic, scalable and gives you the enhanced capabilities to get things done. But, cloud service providers each offer differentiating capabilities on their platform, beyond compute and storage. Cloud native services exist to help you realize the benefits of cloud no matter your provider(s). As an example, the recently announced AWS SageMaker Canvas enables business analysts to start leveraging the power of AI/ML even if you’re not staffed with a team of data scientists. To be sure, multi- cloud environments can keep agencies from being locked into one vendor’s platform and let you shift workloads between them. However, introducing a multi-cloud environment can create complexities and challenges that aren’t always outweighed by those benefits. 3. Cut Through Red Tape and Unintentional Complexity Inevitably, operating on multiple clouds will create additional complexity. But complexity can be managed and can even be instructive. Agencies should be sure that the introduction of a new cloud platform doesn’t result in siloed workstreams or intractable procedural hurdles. The cloud is about expanding capabilities: about doing more, handling more workloads, becoming more flexible. Designating one environment as a home base, or SSO, and then understanding how to seamlessly leverage specific clouds for specific workloads will give your organization agility and insights like never before. 4. Do the Planning Necessary to Support Your Cloud Needs Today and into the Future Cloud vendors are constantly evolving and regularly deploying new services and capabilities that could help solve some of your agency’s toughest challenges. Planning and strategic thinking around the cloud should be happening all the time, and it should inform the answers to questions like:  Which cloud is right for my organization? Am I introducing unnecessary complexity with this choice? Is the security as good?  These are essential considerations for any agency; and the answers will differ based on your mission and business needs. Your cloud strategy will continually evolve, and it requires attention and planning just like any other capability. At GDIT, we see our role as a partner to agencies in helping them deliver on their missions and address the challenges that can arise along the way. This is why we invest in the time, training, and talent necessary to help our customers become even more effective and strategic as they deliver on their missions and advance them.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ever before, and there are more tools at their disposal than ever before to make sense of it. Deriving value from data can transform the way agencies deliver services and, ultimately, positively impacting the people they serve. Today, artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, intelligent automation and cognitive agents are being used to support missions in entirely new ways. The following examples represent is a new way of using analytics to solve hard problems. Detecting fraudulent Medicare payments at CMS: Machine learning is identifying potentially fraudulent Medicare payments at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. In a single day, CMS receives millions of claims representing billions in payments. Our team leveraged machine learning alongside regression analysis, link analysis, outlier detection and behavioral analysis to identify risky providers, which has given CMS the ability to analyze large volumes of data that went previously unanalyzed. Classifying medical images for the VA: Working in partnership with the Department of Veterans Affairs, a machine learning-based classifier was developed to help physicians spot malignant skin lesions. We used computer vision and built deep learning image classification models trained on more than 10,000 images of skin lesions. Once field tested, primary care providers may be able to use the tool to more rapidly and accurately diagnose these conditions, many of which may have gone undetected as care was delayed during the pandemic. Mission Insights discovers value from data Without question, analytics are evolving – and will continue to evolve – the way that agencies deliver services. They’re also evolving the way that agency support partners must show up for them. At GDIT, an intentional methodology was developed to get value from data called Mission Insights, and we’re seeing spectacular results. Mission Insights is a cloud-native analytics platform that allows us to ingest multiple types of data, enrich it with a host of AI/ML services and present it to users in an interface that allows them to search it, study it, build models or create alerts about items that are of interest to them. From there, with Mission Insights, users have access to a suite of services from AWS. This includes entity extraction, text indexing, sentiment analysis, language translation, image and video entity extraction, predictive analytics and more. On the backend, the innovations in Mission Insights also leverage AWS services, such as continuous integration-continuous deployment (CI/CD), infrastructure as code, event-driven architectures, data pipelines, zero trust security and serverless state programming library support. In partnership with customers, we’re using Mission Insights to discover high-value use cases and develop strategic analytics roadmaps. Recent roadmap exercises are already shaping analytics initiatives at CMS, FAA, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the Office of Personnel Management, to name a few.

Our experience across a variety of capabilities includes: Secure credential document design and delivery Life-cycle credential issuance equipment Personalization facilities and support Modular credential personalization management systems Biometric identity proofing Support for development, integration, implementation, and operations Agencies need to stay ahead of the curve, meet the evolving demand for credentials, and maintain the public’s trust in their credentials. Our experience has provided us insight into four major challenge areas that issuing agencies face: Securing Customer Data Securing Customer Data : Every element of providing personal credentials to the public hinges on the ability to trust that the document is kept with the upmost security and accurately identifies an individual person.  No detail is too minute, no process is too mundane.  We recognize that security is the hub upon which quality of service, innovation, and ultimately trust rely on to provide the secure credential as an output. GDIT has a proven and sincere commitment to delivering top-end identity document security tools, processes, and people.  We are known globally for the trust that DoD, DHS and other organizations have in us to secure their personal data. We work to shape and stay ahead of industry trends, and ahead of bad actors, by continuously evolving and advancing our capabilities in line with the evolving security threat landscape. Quality of Service Quality of Service : GDIT has operational experience across multiple customers, multiple use cases, and multiple challenges. Over 20 years in this space, we’ve issued more than 100 million credentials. Our teams are committed to the customer mission and to flawless delivery of service. We pay attention to every detail; we stand up data-driven teams intent on capturing, measuring, and reporting information that makes our programs better and better. We value our relationships with customers and take pride in ensuring we are supporting them – going above and beyond – in every facet of our work. Innovation Innovation : The credentialing space is becoming increasingly more and more technical. Agencies must have partners that display an operational and organizational culture of innovation that keeps them ahead of negative intentions and events. GDIT has established a culture that encourages and invites innovation across our business. In credentialing, we leverage next generation identity security that is adaptive and best in class, throughout the lifespan of our contractual partnerships. We have an Innovation Lab (with hardware and software components and laser engraving equipment) located in Northern Virginia that incorporates customer input, insight, and access. Here, we work on tomorrow’s secure credentialing use cases so we can bring secure, impactful solutions to our customers faster than ever. Serving as a Trusted Partner Serving as a Trusted Partner : Trust underpins any engagement with a credentialing partner. Trust is gained by establishing a track record of dependability and transparency. Dependability is about being a reliable, performant partner to our customers. It’s about evolving our work as customer needs evolve and the landscape changes. It’s proving your worth day in and day out. Transparency is about operating with the customer’s best interests in mind. Sometimes that means having direct and open conversations. Other times, it means ensuring our teams are conversant in multiple solutions so that we can apply the most appropriate one to each specific customer need. Our interests lie in the outcomes we deliver, not the tools that get us there.  We are vendor agnostic and a true Systems Integrator. As credentialing needs evolve, and as the technology to support it does too, we look forward to continuing to be a trusted partner to clients across a spectrum of needs and scenarios.

CYBER"," The new $1 trillion  Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal  is the largest federal investment in infrastructure in more than a decade. In addition to providing significant new federal funding for roads, bridges, water systems and more, it also has new funding for cyber investment. OUR CAPABILITIES OUR CAPABILITIES Learn more about GDIT’s Cybersecurity practice. CYBER The funding has the potential to make real impact – if it is deployed in a manner that allows state and local governments to leverage their existing infrastructure to truly improve their cybersecurity postures. Along with the recent  Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity , these investments, including $1 billion for modernizing state and local networks to defend against cyberattacks and $100 million for a new cyber response and recovery fund accessible to private entities that own critical infrastructure, signal the importance of cybersecurity as a critical national security priority. So where should state and local agencies start in effectively investing these new funds? It depends on the maturity of your cybersecurity strategy and where you are on your journey to implement it. To help with this, I’ve outlined some key steps that will help agencies deploy this funding effectively. 1. Assess your cybersecurity risk profile Agencies need to understand where their organization fits within the cybersecurity threat landscape. As an example, A 2019 ransomware attack on a major US city had a devastating impact across the city’s services. It also effected business outside the city’s control. One example is that the hack halted real estate transactions. Sometimes the victim of an attack provides essential services to the intended target. The bottom line: We’re all connected, and it’s essential that, when it comes to cybersecurity, agencies know where they are in any risk chain. This information won’t help you buy anything, but it will help put any investments into context so that anything you do procure can be deployed to help address your risk. 2. Discover all your assets A baseline cybersecurity goal should be to know where all of your assets are and what they’re doing at any given time. Teams should take inventory of what they have, clearly identify what’s in an environment, what’s on, what’s off and assess the overall health of the environment – we call this defining the protect surface. As an exercise, cybersecurity leaders should be able to pick five assets at random and three dates, also at random, and pinpoint who used the asset, what the users did and whether any software was installed or removed. If you can’t do that, invest in infrastructure and endpoint monitoring software, stat. 3. Examine your service accounts Service accounts are essentially accounts created by computers to perform functions on other computers or on themselves. They have escalated privileges to perform certain tasks. When installing software, root credentials create these accounts for the software, which means the programs inherit permissions and rights that are much higher than necessary. What’s worse, these accounts are usually created with default usernames and passwords and with admin rights they shouldn’t have. Many of the recent major breaches leveraged service accounts by using the same credentials moving from machine to machine to machine within a network. As the organization moves to multi-factor authentication (MFA) don’t neglect the management of service accounts. Do your existing cyber tools have privileged access management capabilities? If not, plan to change that immediately. 4. Invest in security incident and event management The worst thing that can happen in a cyber breach is to not know what happened. So, agencies without a dashboard that can tell them should invest in security incident and event management (SIEM), the ability to monitor and manage your existing tools in a single location. As an example, if your website goes down, the reason could be because of a cyberattack or faulty hardware. Without SIEM, you’re starting an investigation into what happened from zero. You’re flying blind. The resolution is different depending on the cause of the issue, but effective, continuous monitoring will find it and identify the cause quickly. 5. Leverage automation Automation, specifically, artificial intelligence-based Security Orchestration Automation Response (SOAR), can give agencies greater capacity and agility in responding to cyber threats. With it, they can rely on software to detect anomalies and deploy human to created responses, essential in a market facing a shortage of talent, as cybersecurity is. Of course, SOAR doesn’t work without SIEM, so agencies with a mature SIEM are well positioned to now leverage the variety of available automation tools to enhance their cybersecurity strategies. 6. Embrace a zero trust model Agencies on solid ground on each of the items above are now in a position to embrace a Zero Trust model. In zero trust, data is the central consideration and access to it is protected based on the business-critical nature of that data. As an example, when I work remotely, I cannot access company financial data. When I’m in the office, I can. I’m the same person, but I’m on a different network and sometimes on a different device when I work from home. Agencies should begin to develop and deploy their zero trust strategies in order to protect their mission-critical data and services. Today, GDIT is having conversations with IT leaders at the state and local level to help them deploy their limited resources in the most effective and efficient ways possible. Certainly, this new funding will be welcomed at all levels, and the role of systems integrators is to help customers at every stage in their cybersecurity journey. Across federal, state, and local agencies this is the kind of mission-enabling collaboration that GDIT teams bring to the table for our customers.

Among them: the velocity of change that cloud services provide; the ability to take advantage of economies of scale to save money or reduce costs; and, finally, the benefits that automation delivers within managed services that make it easier to move into DevSecOps and agile development methodologies.

I come from a long line of service – two great uncles fought in WWII in Italy and Guadalcanal, both grandfathers supported the war effort – one in an ammunition factory, the other as medical specialist on a hospital ship in the Pacific. My mother served for five years in the Air Force and attained the rank of Captain. My father also served in the Air Force, and flew the F-111, the U-2, the B-52, and 133 combat missions in Vietnam flying the F-105 over a career that spanned 26 years. Both of my parents imbued in me that value of serving our country with dedication, determination, and distinction. I wouldn't be where I am today without their love, guidance, influence, advice, and direction. Finally, my two children, Dean and Dana, have supported me throughout the last part of my career, through challenging times when duty called and I worked late, to when I was gone for a yearlong deployment, and now in my new role as a civilian. Living by the Army values – Loyalty, Duty, Respect, Selfless Service, Honor, Integrity, and Personal Courage – has helped me immensely with my career at GDIT. These values neatly integrate with the GDIT values of Honesty, Trust, Transparency, and Alignment. The combined values keep me grounded, make me a reliable teammate, and help me to focus on doing the right thing at the right time to support our customers as well as our internal GDIT team."" We thank these veterans for their service and for sharing their stories. We are fortunate to have them, and hundreds like them, at GDIT making us a better, stronger organization.

Transforming the Traditional PMO to a Value Management Office,IT service management (ITSM) needs to focus on customer and stakeholder engagement and an objective method for measuring the value IT creates. Rob Smallwood is Vice President of Digital Modernization at ITSM. He explains how to transform IT SMEs from a PMO to a Value Management Office (VMO). The VMO needs to create the Customer Engagement Role and the Innovation and Improvement Role to drive value creation and performance.,"This role, and the individuals or teams filling it within the VMO works to: Identify potential improvements from operational engagements, trend analysis, and performance metric reviews and assess potential value Identify and/or create innovation infrastructure such as labs, innovation ceremonies and reach back mechanisms Provide a centralized hub that offers an enterprise view across all improvements for awareness and reporting Foster an innovative environment by conducting lessons learned sessions, encouraging the team and broader user community to submit ideas, and recognizing or rewarding contributors Work with customer engagement and other parts of the organization to identify potential innovation opportunities or capture innovations that have been completed on a particular team Keep an up to date understanding of the industry to include market trends, emergent solutions, successes at other organizations and updates from vendor alliances and more These two key functions offer the VMO an enterprise view across the entire program and work collaboratively to ensure the customer and stakeholder perspective is always in view.Not Movie Magic, But a Mosaic of Multi-Factor Authentication Tools 4 MIN READ DIGITAL MODERNIZATION,  MANAGED SERVICES Achieving Mission Success: Best Practices to Foster Effective Collaboration Among Contractors 2 MIN READ DIGITAL MODERNIZATION,  HOMELAND SECURITY,  INTELLIGENCE Mission Possible: A Modern Approach to Supporting Global Missions 54 MIN WATCH CYBER,  DEFENSE,  DIGITAL MODERNIZATION,  ZERO TRUST Dispatch from TechNet IndoPac: MPEs & ICAM to Enhance Warfighter CapabilityIn this environment, the traditional Program Management Office (PMO) must transform into a  Value Management Office (VMO)  that is focused on customer and stakeholder engagement alongside an objective method for measuring the value that IT creates.","customer, value, role, vmo, metric, traditional, improvement, innovation, mission, program","traditional pmo, digital modernization, customer engagement role, innovation improvement role, enterprise view, value metric, emergent solution, entire program, stakeholder perspective, key result",DIGITAL MODERNIZATION,"As IT service management (ITSM) has matured, perceptions are changing about the value that IT provides for customers, users, stakeholders, and an agency’s overall mission.

DIGITAL MODERNIZATION"," As IT service management (ITSM) has matured, perceptions are changing about the value that IT provides for customers, users, stakeholders, and an agency’s overall mission. Technology is a driver of transformation within agencies, and it is impacting the way they deliver services and meet their missions. OUR CAPABILITIES OUR CAPABILITIES Learn how we're helping IT environments focus on customers and value. DIGITAL MODERNIZATION The traditional methods for managing IT programs and teams are no longer adequate. IT teams must ensure they are sufficiently engaging with stakeholders, effectively identifying the demands and opportunities, and ultimately co-creating value for the organization. This value is created by two things: First, meeting and exceeding customer requirements and service level agreements (SLAs). And second, identifying and implementing of mission-aligned and user-aligned improvements and innovations that drive down costs, improve effectiveness or reduce risk. In this environment, the traditional Program Management Office (PMO) must transform into a  Value Management Office (VMO)  that is focused on customer and stakeholder engagement alongside an objective method for measuring the value that IT creates. This is an important distinction; it’s an elevation of the traditional PMO in that the VMO’s focus is on adding increased and incremental value over time. New Roles Support a New Focus Successfully transforming from a traditional PMO to a VMO depends on the creation of two essential roles: The Customer Engagement Role and the Innovation and Improvement Role. While the VMO still maintains responsibility for the traditional aspects of a PMO, these two additional functions will help to drive value creation and performance. The Customer Engagement Role The Customer Engagement Role  is tightly connected with architecture and overall strategy development. The role, scaled appropriately given the size of the agency, team or remit, can be filled by an individual, a group of individuals or an entire team. The idea is that there is a well communicated expectation that the VMO will do at least the following: Understand that agencies aren’t one-size-fits-all, be sure to build intimate knowledge of different user groups across the organization, as well as understand those users’ perceptions of the services that are currently provided. Identify demands and opportunities that the standard ticketing system doesn’t capture. Act as liaisons with the user groups and stakeholders on development and engineering initiatives as part of an integrated DevSecOps team The Innovation and Improvement Role The Innovation and Improvement Role  is an expansion of the traditional continual service improvement role that historically has been internally focused. The innovation and improvement role not only looks internally at various program metrics to identify improvements, but also looks externally to understand what is happening in the industry, commercial markets, other Federal agencies, and emergent solutions. This role, and the individuals or teams filling it within the VMO works to: Identify potential improvements from operational engagements, trend analysis, and performance metric reviews and assess potential value Identify and/or create innovation infrastructure such as labs, innovation ceremonies and reach back mechanisms Provide a centralized hub that offers an enterprise view across all improvements for awareness and reporting Foster an innovative environment by conducting lessons learned sessions, encouraging the team and broader user community to submit ideas, and recognizing or rewarding contributors Work with customer engagement and other parts of the organization to identify potential innovation opportunities or capture innovations that have been completed on a particular team Keep an up to date understanding of the industry to include market trends, emergent solutions, successes at other organizations and updates from vendor alliances and more These two key functions offer the VMO an enterprise view across the entire program and work collaboratively to ensure the customer and stakeholder perspective is always in view. “ These two key functions offer the VMO an enterprise view across the entire program and work collaboratively to ensure the customer and stakeholder perspective is always in view. ” Rob Smallwood Rob Smallwood Vice President of Digital Modernization New Metrics Drive New Outcomes and Opportunities Successfully transforming from a traditional PMO to a VMO also requires a shift in thinking about metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs). The VMO should still track, monitor, and report on traditional metrics related to the program, as a traditional PMO would, but it will also incorporate value-based metrics and KPIs. These metrics help to determine whether the program and the proposed innovations and improvements are actually providing the value intended. As with any metric, teams must establish targets for each KPI in order to calibrate their performance in relation to the KPI. Ideally, this is done in partnership with the customer. It’s also important to tie value metrics to mission objectives. Each agency typically has overarching agency-specific mission objectives. From that, IT crafts specific objectives that will help achieve those objectives through IT and related key results. These IT objectives inform VMO metrics. For the customer engagement role, the objective could be “Provide robust meaningful customer engagement.” The overall objective can be long term and more aspirational whereas the key results would be time bound and focused on achieving specific goals. As key results are achieved, new KRs can be added or modified. The idea is to integrate a series of value-driven metrics into the program, driven by the VMO, that demonstrate value to the customer beyond the metrics that are contractually required. In an IT environment focused on customers and value, traditional PMOs must evolve so that they are as strategically aligned as they are tactically aligned. This is precisely what we endeavor to do at GDIT and are actively working to implement with our customer partners. It’s another dimension of imagining –  and then delivering  – the art of the possible.

OUR CAPABILITIES OUR CAPABILITIES Learn more about our cybersecurity approach and work. CYBER The Network Access session featured invited guest Patrick Perry, the Director of Federal Emerging Technical Solutions at  Zscaler , which has developed a Zero Trust Exchange platform and is a leader in the Zero Trust security space. He joined GDIT cybersecurity leads to talk about why Zero Trust Network Access is so important. “Applications are everywhere, and users are too,” he said. “The importance of identity and device context when creating conditional access has been growing over time. Connectivity needs to be more of a per-application basis, rather than entire networks.” The fourth and final session was on Software Defined Perimeters and Segmentation and featured Jonathan Roy, Principal Security Architect at  Appgate , which is an identity-centric, network enforced perimeter security solution, designed around user and device identity. SDP builds a multi-dimensional profile of a user or device to authorize a user before granting access. It applies the principle of least privilege to the network to enforce the Zero Trust model. He spoke about the importance of understanding users, devices, and behaviors on a given platform or network and then using that information to make access decisions in real-time and on a continuous basis. “We focus on creating a unified policy edge that can read in telemetry data and decision data creating more of a global entity,” he said. “The second piece is that we want to reduce a lot of the complexity in traditional, choke-point architectures and, instead, take a data- centric approach without increasing complexity… and do it in real-time to define what a user should and shouldn’t be able to see.” Just as previous sessions, recordings of the sessions were made available to all GDIT staff, maximizing their impact and reach and reaffirming our commitment to ensuring our staff are as informed and up-to-speed on emerging technologies as possible – in the cybersecurity domain and elsewhere. Earlier sessions featured Palo Alto Networks and Crowdstrike, discussing cloud workload protection and endpoint protection respectively. “We’re so grateful to all of the industry partners who participated in this event with us. We understand that collaboration and the sharing of ideas are what drives innovation, ” GDIT Cybersecurity Vice President and Cybersecurity Center of Excellence Lead Dr. Matthew McFadden said. “It’s so important that we hear from industry about what they’re developing and, at the same time, that they hear from us about the challenges we’re solving for customers.

Rajeev Karamchedu, Program Manager for the company’s Prisma Cloud, talked about Zero Trust and its impact on Cloud Workload Protection. Importantly, he noted that when it comes to workload protection there is a place for Zero Trust among users, applications, and infrastructure. “When we put all of these functional domains together, you get a matrix, and you can see how any cloud workload protection approach should work and especially how Prisma Cloud enables Zero Trust.” GDIT Cyber Tech Exchange 2021 Partner Presentation by Palo Alto Networks   WATCH NOW |  0 Karamchedu also told the group that the world of containers and legacy virtual machines will continue for a while and, unlike cloud migration, there is likely no such a thing as ‘lift-and-shift’ model for Zero Trust. So, he continued, partners need to help agencies take pieces of a Zero Trust architecture and apply it in priority areas, across the matrix, while helping them answer questions and being careful not  “shove a square peg into a round hole.” The second of the sessions focused on Endpoint Protection Platforms and featured Larry Kovalsky, Director of Federal Sales Engineering, from Crowdstrike. He talked about the company’s Falcon platform and its endpoint security capabilities, specifically how it enables the “1- 10-60” framework, which is a metric Crowdstrike uses to measure its performance in the event of an incident. It aims to detect or prevent an incident in under a minute; to investigate and understand it in under 10 minutes; and to contain and remediate the issue in under 60 minutes. “If you let things go over an hour, that’s when things get pretty ugly … [so] if we can prevent things from getting to a full-fledged breach in under an hour, that’s a worthy goal,” Kovalsky said.

NESD ashore, around the globe. The Navy saw an opportunity to leverage automation, artificial intelligence and cloud technology to consolidate 90 different service desks, driving better, faster outcomes for users. To me, the project was near and dear to my heart. When I served in the Navy, I used the Service Desk and understood the importance of ensuring Sailors get the help they need when they needed it. Our newly developed Service Desk as a Service (SDaaS) solution fit the bill entirely. It brings secure, cloud based artificial intelligence together with the leading technological advancements to warfighters. It provides the best possible end-user experience and enables the consolidation of multiple service desks into one; and we knew it could dramatically transform the NESD for the better. From the outset of the project – which began with a whitepaper of our solution along with 21 other vendors, down-selected to the bakeoff  between two vendors  – to the eventual award, GDIT brought its best to the table. Our technical solution was sound, but so too was our understanding of the customer and the mission. We demonstrated our knowledge of the environment and commitment to the program throughout the process, alongside our flexibility and agility. Throughout the process, there was exceptional collaboration across every GDIT competency. We leveraged our Technology Shared Services (TSS) Center and the talent there; we consulted with experts from the office of our Chief Technology Officer; and taped into our Cloud and Cyber Centers of Excellence. We also worked with our Navy and Marine Corps business partners, and our alliance partners at AWS, BMC, IPSoft and others. Our solution allows GDIT to partner with the Navy in consolidating Tier-1 IT service desks from a human centered subject matter expert (SME)-based business model to a knowledge-based business model powered by artificial intelligence. “ By leveraging automation and standardized processes, it will help the Navy save costs both today and in the future with increased efficiencies and user experiences. ” Travis Dawson Travis Dawson Senior Program Manager, GDIT This complex, yet critically important effort, will pave the way for an even better performing NESD in the future. The entire effort aligns with the Navy’s strategic goals around bringing its infrastructure to parity with industry best practices; driving capabilities and outcomes that deliver a competitive advantage; and enabling the Navy to “defend forward” with robust information protection and analysis capabilities. The NESD project was an exciting one to pursue, win and – now – execute. I know we’ll bring incredible results to the program, and we’ve assembled an incredible team to do it.

CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP high school sophomores, juniors, and seniors. GDIT was honored to participate and to have our summer mentees join the ranks of the more than 5,100 new GWC SIP graduates – the largest class the program has ever had! As an organization, GWC is focused on more than just code. It’s working to build the largest pipeline of future female engineers and is on a mission to close the gender gap in technology and change the image of what a programmer looks like and does. Doing that, of course, requires learning about teamwork and camaraderie, and building a sense of inclusiveness and accomplishment for everyone involved. The SIP is designed to create avenues for participants to work on projects that provide them with precisely those opportunities. The program offers insight into what it means to work in the technology field – which is about much more than learning how to code. It’s about how to navigate the workplace, the challenges they’ll face, and what the future of the field looks like. This real-world experience is extremely valuable and unique to the program. “ Students involved in STEM are the future of our company and country. That’s why we support organizations that help to advance STEM education and programming, particularly in underserved communities. ” Kristie Grinnell Kristie Grinnell GDIT Global Chief Information Officer The GWC SIP model depends heavily on corporate partnerships. GDIT leapt at the opportunity to develop programming for a series of engagement sessions, mentoring workshops and activities covering topics like: A  “Story of My Name” Activity “Story of My Name” Activity , where participants shared the origins of their names and learned more about one another’s culture. Social Engineering Scavenger Hunt Social Engineering Scavenger Hunt , where participants learned just how much we can find out about a person on the internet based on public records and their social media activity. This was a true hit, as students were still talking about it at the end of the program! A mentoring session titled,  Managing Your Social Media Presence Managing Your Social Media Presence , with a plenary presentation, followed by small-group breakout discussions with our volunteer mentors. Another mentoring session titled,  An Exploration of Emotional Intelligence An Exploration of Emotional Intelligence , with a plenary presentation and a small-group breakout discussions with our volunteer mentors. A mentoring session titled,  Are You LinkedIn or Linked Out? Are You LinkedIn or Linked Out? , with a plenary presentation and a small-group breakout discussions with our volunteer mentors. Enthusiasm for the program was apparent throughout the company, as more than 70 GDIT team member volunteers, including seven members of our Executive Leadership Team, contributed to the effort. “Providing opportunities for young girls to ‘see themselves’ in an organization is an important way we can help to keep girls engaged in STEM,” Grinnell continued. “It was incredible to see and hear the excitement and happiness from these young women when they spoke about why they wanted to pursue careers in technology, whether it be coding or something else entirely.” GDIT’s support for women and girls in STEM is a focus that continues throughout the year. GDIT’s annual  Women + Tech event  brings together women at different stages of their careers for an inspiring and engaging day that showcases actionable tools, insights, and networking to support career growth and mobility. New for 2021 is an extension of this program to engage young women in their junior and senior year of high school with a Bot-a-Thon hosted by GDIT with partners Deloitte, UiPath and STEM for Her. Students will learn about Robotics Process Automation (RPA) and use those new RPA skills to solve a problem related to Humanitarianism, Cyber Threats, Social Activism and Mental Health. Members of winning teams will receive scholarships for use with school-related costs. The event will take place on October 11th,  learn more and register .

As a passionate mentor of other colleagues, Ron knows that when others see him for all he is, he can better help them be their true selves and reach their personal goals. Opportunities created through great mentorship “My best day at work is when I’m able to help others, influence others, give guidance to junior analysts, and answer their questions,” Ron shares. “Those are the days I feel most valued.” Ron mentors more junior employees and also receives his own mentoring from more senior leaders, creating a full circle of giving back. “Someone mentored me and looked out for me, so it’s my obligation and responsibility - and pleasure - to be able to do it for others.” His official and unofficial mentors over his six years at GDIT have influenced his career and have given him the confidence to raise his hand for new opportunities. Ron proactively got on the calendar of the business development leader when he wanted to move into a business development role. A conversation about his career goals soon led to a new role in the group. “Sometimes you have to create your own path. It was an opportunity that wasn’t particularly advertised, but I wanted to have that conversation and see what I could do, and it worked out.” Ron found that his leaders were supportive of him creating new opportunities and he’s excited about the work he’s now doing. Being himself, even on the hard days Ron feels like he can bring his whole self to work every day, regardless of what’s going on in his life. “From days when I feel great, I’m high energy, full of life to days when I’m maybe a bit down, dragging, I still bring my authentic self. I don’t feel like I have to wear a mask if it’s been a tough day or a tough week.” He’s felt that most during the racial injustice movement this past summer and has seen the organization become more inclusive of everyone’s individual experiences. “If someone’s dealing with experiences in life, while we don’t want it to affect our work, life creeps in and that’s where it’s important for us to have resources. People to be able to talk to, Employee Resource Groups and mentors, all fill that need.” Leading and growing the Black Employee Network Speaking of Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), Ron is the co-lead of the Black Employee Network (BEN) at GDIT. When he started attending meetings a few years ago, the group was small, and engagement inconsistent. Now, they’re 500 members strong and growing. “One of the things that really motivates me and what I really enjoy about being at GDIT, is being able to shape and be a part of that diverse and inclusive community that we’re creating.” Learn about GDIT, our culture and what we value. LEARN MORE The group really took off after organizing events around Black History Month in February 2020 and also through the support they gave members during the social uprising in the summer of that same year. “We started the Black Employee Network sessions and it’s an open forum where we invite any and everyone who’s a part of GDIT to come be a part of the conversation.” The sessions have included leaders, like GDIT’s president, and are leading to collective goals and strategies to make GDIT more inclusive. “We’re all going to work together and we’re going to make GDIT be a better organization. It’s already good, but we’re going to make it the best it can possibly be by having everyone feel comfortable and be their full and complete self.” TAGS TAGS OUR CULTURE  Related 2 MIN READ CYBER,  OUR CULTURE AI Powers Up Cyber Resilience: A Look Back at Our Successful Cyber Hackathon 3 MIN READ OUR CULTURE How One GDIT Engineer Is Helping Students Find Their Career Paths 2 MIN READ OUR CULTURE 23 GDIT Engineers to Receive Honors at the 2022 BEYA STEM Conference 3 MIN READ OUR CULTURE Inspiring the Next Generation of STEM Leaders "

She’s seen GDIT take steps toward fostering a more inclusive culture over the years and credits the Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) with creating a safe space for all employees. “All the ERG groups we have now, they’re so active and they’re trying to engage everyone at all levels, I think that speaks very highly of GDIT and the type of culture they are creating for everyone.” Gabby is the co-lead for the Hispano Latinx Association ERG, affectionately known as HOLA. “We’ve been very active the last few years to try to get more inclusiveness in GDIT within the Latinx community,” she says. “We work with recruiting to make sure we see more diversity at all levels and overall, it’s a great community to share ideas and experiences about being Latinx at GDIT.” OUR CULTURE OUR CULTURE Learn more about our commitment to Diversity and Inclusion. DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION How are they sharing the Latinx experience? Through events and activities that give their ERG members a voice. A large program out of Mexico has a local chapter for HOLA. They hosted an event to talk about Mexico and their love for the country. It was a fun way to virtually tour Mexico while also sharing the diversity of the Latinx experience. Gabby sees these activities as ways to create connections around similar passions. “It creates a safe for conversations and somewhere where you can bring your whole self. It creates a space to have tough conversations, to ask for advice from people that may have also had your same experiences.” Discovering ways to own her career Inclusion isn’t just about ERGs though. It’s also about how you’re valued and respected in your role. Gabby has felt valued and engaged through stretch assignments that allow her teams to really see her potential. “Recently we won a major contract and we had to staff more than 100 positions. This was really a stretch assignment because of the short transition timeline,” she says about the project. “I remember struggling a little bit at the beginning because every day, every hour, you’re making decisions. And I was feeling a little bit overwhelmed.” Gabby’s leader was there for her. He gave her the support she needed and encouraged her to make those important decisions and learn from anything that didn’t work out as planned. “That was key in really moving forward with the project and knowing that as long as we got 90 percent correct during the transition, we were on the right path. Just knowing that he believed in my efforts and my abilities, I think that was key for me.” From co-leading an ERG to staffing impactful projects, Gabby has the opportunity to own her career in meaningful ways. “If you look around GDIT, at all levels of leadership, you’ll see diversity and that makes you feel that you can achieve things. And it helps make sure that you can dream for yourself and in dreaming, it allows you to bring in your whole self into work and achieve your goals.” TAGS TAGS OUR CULTURE  Related 2 MIN READ CYBER,  OUR CULTURE AI Powers Up Cyber Resilience: A Look Back at Our Successful Cyber Hackathon 3 MIN READ OUR CULTURE How One GDIT Engineer Is Helping Students Find Their Career Paths 2 MIN READ OUR CULTURE 23 GDIT Engineers to Receive Honors at the 2022 BEYA STEM Conference 3 MIN READ OUR CULTURE Inspiring the Next Generation of STEM Leaders "

And we recognize the importance of retaining the critical talent that has been an essential part of DOD programs by prioritizing internal mobility and professional development as core elements of our people strategy.” When it comes to accelerating cloud adoption, there are challenges to collectively overcome but there is also immense opportunity in doing so. This is why GDIT works tirelessly to help customers solve and navigate these challenges so that they can capitalize on the opportunity in the cloud and advance their essential and uncompromising missions.

Part leadership development program, part personal growth opportunity, the NMC CTC has helped Aisha step out of her day-to-day technical role to discover a path to where a career at GDIT can take her. From tech lead to future leader Nominated by her program leadership, Aisha joined the NMC CTC program earlier this year. The program was created to identify and promote top talent within the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corp GDIT teams and Aisha easily fit the criteria. Aisha is the technical lead for a data science team that is helping the U.S. Navy transform the way it identifies and mitigates risk among its various squadrons. She joined GDIT a year ago and her impact on the customer mission has already shown her potential as a future leader in the organization. The CTC program is giving her the skills she needs to advance in her career outside of her technical expertise. “The CTC program helps with understanding the business side of contracts, the overall mission, and even the financial side of things,” shared Aisha. “And it also helps us see the bigger picture instead of just being focused on the daily tasks.” Learning across all levels What Aisha appreciates most about the program is the collaboration with current managers and access to senior level leadership. The CTC program includes everyone from early-in-career professionals to experts in their fields, giving the cohort the opportunity to learn from each other in addition to structured development opportunities. “The CTC has a number of managers and those in senior positions,” said Aisha. “In the breakout sessions, they talk a lot about different issues that arise and how they would address this or what they could do to be a better leader. And I get to be the fly on the wall. I’m not a manager now, but I can at least think like a leader.” Part of the program includes interacting with senior leaders, like the CTO of GDIT’s Defense Division. Aisha participated in a breakout session with the CTO and after he learned about her work, he connected her with the Data Science and Machine Learning Communities of Interest so she could continue to build a wider network at GDIT. Reflecting on that experience, Aisha said, “I thought that was really cool because it’s not happened before. And I think that shows GDIT’s culture. I’ve noticed upper management is always looking out for their people, and they want them to excel. And I love that.” Getting out of her comfort zone Learn how GDIT is investing in professional development experiences for our people. LEARN MORE Michael White, co-creator of the program, also serves as a champion for the CTC participants. He meets one-on-one with each cohort member to learn their interests and career goals. As one of the program leaders, he also looks for opportunities to get cohort members involved with things outside their comfort zones. After receiving an email from Michael, Aisha raised her hand to work on a business development opportunity—something she’d never done before. “I was helping figure out contracts that have a contract sell out potential. I’m still not an expert in it by any means, but it helped me look at things from a high-level standpoint when it comes to the mission, when it comes to projects and the contracts.” The CTC program is developing current and future leaders to give them the skills and confidence to create an even greater impact on their customer missions, as well as for GDIT as a whole. Seeing the bigger picture is one of Aisha’s biggest takeaways and she’s bringing that viewpoint back to her customer. “Through the CTC, I was able to view the mission from more of a strategic level as opposed to the tactical level, where I would ordinarily just focus on the day-to-day tasks. I’m now able to get a better sense of what the bigger picture is and how much effort it takes to get where we’re at,” Aisha said. “Taking you out of your comfort zone is really helpful for professional growth and development.” TAGS TAGS OUR CULTURE  Related 2 MIN READ CYBER,  OUR CULTURE AI Powers Up Cyber Resilience: A Look Back at Our Successful Cyber Hackathon 3 MIN READ OUR CULTURE How One GDIT Engineer Is Helping Students Find Their Career Paths 2 MIN READ OUR CULTURE 23 GDIT Engineers to Receive Honors at the 2022 BEYA STEM Conference 3 MIN READ OUR CULTURE Inspiring the Next Generation of STEM Leaders "

DIGITAL MODERNIZAITON ," OUR CAPABILITIES OUR CAPABILITIES Learn how GDIT works with customers to harness the full potential of automation technologies and our digital modernization capabilities at large. DIGITAL MODERNIZAITON  Automation is driving new innovations and transforming entire industries. In the government contracting space, the implementation of some automation technologies can unfortunately and unnecessarily become complicated by policy or security regulations. This is why GDIT has placed a priority on helping our customers take advantage of automation in ways that advance and accelerate their missions. We know that as agencies modernize and expand their operations to the cloud, as they gather and analyze data increasingly at the edge of their networks, and as they continue to embrace agile principles to adapt quickly to evolving mission imperatives and security threats, automation can – and should – play a key role. GDIT Senior Director, Information Systems Security,  Shaleen Braley Shaleen Braley  recently talked with  FedScoop  about how agencies, no matter where they are in their modernization journey, can unleash automation – even on legacy systems. However, she noted, doing so is not without challenges. She pointed to the objectives existing between commercial cloud and government policies that inherently contribute to different approaches to automation at-large.  Integrators like GDIT – given  their  familiarity with government requirements and missions as well as with the capabilities that exist in the commercial cloud  – can help bridge that divide. Additionally, GDIT’s  Rob Smallwood Rob Smallwood , Vice President for Digital Modernization and Enterprise IT, talked with  FedScoop  about how GDIT dynamically provisions secure and classified IT capabilities across multiple security boundaries  while meeting the “speed of need.” He highlighted the reality that agencies need to take a closer look at the power of integrating and automating a combination of state-of- the-art technologies so that they will be able to handle the “astronomical cross-domain workloads that our nation depends on now and in the future.” As an example, he pointed to one of the most critical projects on which GDIT has delivered: automating managed services for information sharing across different military classification levels with coalition partners. The task involved not only automating the nation’s most stringent security requirements, but also doing so across some of the most diverse IT environments that exist around the world. The COVID-19 pandemic and the near-overnight shift to remote working across the federal overnment proved that new and emerging cloud and automation technologies can be successfully and securely implemented. The continued embrace of these technologies – and the continued demonstration of their value to agencies and missions – is essential. Across our customer portfolio, including on large-scale contracts, GDIT has proven our ability to deliver a large swath of enterprise IT services at scale.

LEARN MORE monthly sessions that create a platform and a collaborative environment for participants to network, receive leadership training, and gain experiences that mature their abilities as leaders, managers, and technicians – all of which equips them to tackle customer challenges today and into the future. “ We know that personal growth and commitment to the job and the mission comes through experiences ” Michael White Michael White NMC-CTC Program Co-Creator Michael White, one of the creators of the NMC-CTC program put it best:  “We know that personal growth and commitment to the job and the mission comes through experiences,”  he said.  “When creating this program, we wanted to identify and provide opportunities for top talent in the Navy Marine Corps business area – not based on level or position, but on which talent could deliver impact for the customer.” White and GDIT Senior HR Business Partner Lauren Spear created the program with an eye toward building a different kind of development opportunity. They wanted to make the program engaging and experiential, and something that could deliver immediate value to participants. They focused on three core pillars: networking and exposure to senior leaders; business acumen; and leadership training. Within those pillars, White and Spear developed program components that included monthly speaker sessions, trainings, career planning help, networking events and more. The pillars and program components, together, ensured a holistic and engaging experience for participants. The program, because it brings together a diverse group of talent, levels and roles, creates an inclusive environment where diversity of thought and team camaraderie flourish. Participants are encouraged to look at their individual skillsets and identify areas of opportunity. As an example, one participant knew that in order to advance in his current role, he needed proposal development experience. As part of this program, he was given an opportunity to participate on a proposal review team. From technical leads to project managers, NMC-CTC participants are connected with experiences like this that round out their skillsets, supporting their career growth at GDIT. Additionally, participants get facetime with executive leaders who frequently engage with the group as speakers or mentors. Participants were recently asked to share the name of a GDIT leader they’d like to have a one-on-one career conversation with. These “dream conversations” will be occurring in the coming weeks and promise to be both informational and inspiring for leaders and participants alike. White pointed out that this level of engagement from senior leadership is just one more example of the company’s commitment to its employees. Afterall, as he noted, GDIT is a services organization and the way the company delivers solutions for customers and grows as a business is through our people. “ Cohort participants really value the program and the exposure to leadership ” Lauren Spear Lauren Spear NMC-CTC Program Co-Creator Spear noted that GDIT is already seeing an incredible value from an employee engagement standpoint.  “We’ve had an overwhelming impact and response,”  she said.  “Cohort participants really value the program and the exposure to leadership. They love that it’s about experiences, covers diverse topic materials, focuses on business outcomes; that it’s holistic and goes beyond their day-to-day. It’s not a traditional program and that really sets it apart.” As one might imagine, plans for next year’s cohort are already in the works and interest in participating is high. White and Spear say they’re excited about being able to offer this program to employees and they look forward to seeing how the participants benefit from it for many years to come, throughout the entirety of their careers.

Whether it’s through infusing manager training with a little bit of humor or by showing off his dance skills leading a Zumba class, Chris finds ways to bring all of him to GDIT. As a certified Zumba instructor, Chris was asked to teach a virtual fitness class in a joint event with the PRIDE and HOLA ERGs. “We had people from all over the world at the class. We had a lot of our employees in Latin America join and it was tons of fun. It was very cool to have that outreach to some of the programs that we don’t have regular interaction with.” Bringing allyship forward As a council member for GDIT’s PRIDE ERG, Chris also spends time focusing on activities, community events, and opportunities to help educate employees and provide a safe place for LGBTQ+ team members. Over the years, Chris has seen PRIDE grow and contribute to the community in a number of ways. The group has been involved with a local DC area LGBTQ+ organization, focused on at-risk youth. And they have also created opportunities for important dialogue within GDIT. This past year, PRIDE hosted an education session on allyship that included participation by Amy Gilliland, GDIT’s President. The event was a facilitated discussion around what allyship means to people and what we can all do to become better allies. “Being an ally to me is about so many things. It’s about walking the talk. It’s about being courageous to speak up when you see something that isn’t right. It’s about living your truth every day and being who you are every single day.” Chris sees allyship in action from the organization’s overall support of the ERGs to the day-to-day actions of managers. He shares, “I feel very comfortable bringing my full self to work every day and I know that feeling can’t be created just by a company message. That has to be created within a culture.” TAGS TAGS OUR CULTURE  Related 2 MIN READ CYBER,  OUR CULTURE AI Powers Up Cyber Resilience: A Look Back at Our Successful Cyber Hackathon 3 MIN READ OUR CULTURE How One GDIT Engineer Is Helping Students Find Their Career Paths 2 MIN READ OUR CULTURE 23 GDIT Engineers to Receive Honors at the 2022 BEYA STEM Conference 3 MIN READ OUR CULTURE Inspiring the Next Generation of STEM Leaders "

It provides an atmosphere in which they can come back and continue to serve. As a leader of the military-centered ERG, Craig is focused on supporting internal and external employees. “Many people who are veterans feel the desire to serve and so the ERG not only provides access to resources, but it provides you another avenue to continue to serve your country and support those causes that you feel are really important.” “We also do some things that I consider to be very important, which is helping veterans as they come out of the military find employment. We launched a pilot program recently to offer mentorship and information for transitioning veterans here inside of GDIT.” Veterans are more than 25% of GDIT’s workforce. We understand the impact of their skills and expertise in the workplace, which is why we are dedicated to recruiting veterans, service family members, wounded warriors, and their caregivers. “GDIT is committed to hiring veterans. We’re using the reach of the ERG to contact those people we know because our common saying is that every veteran knows five other veterans. We help connect those individuals to our talent acquisition team and assist other veterans like me as they leave the military to find employment to carry them on through their second career.” Craig has found that sharing his story has been the most successful support method. “I try to share my experience about the things that went well and the things that didn’t go well. I work to make their transition out of the military as smooth as possible and with every hope that they can come to a company just like GDIT.” In the trenches with hard conversations Much more than a social group, the ERGs are a vital part of the employee experience. They work to provide a community that allows for a safe place for difficult conversations. While he joined the Honor ERG initially as an opportunity to network and learn more about the company, Craig quickly found himself back in a leadership role. “I got involved with the employee resource group. They asked me to lead it and I felt like there were a number of skills that I had built in the military that would become applicable to leading, from planning the activities to looking long-range to understanding what the ERG did for the company as a whole.” Honor takes on a number of veteran-related causes in support of the larger veteran community. “We’ve supported important topics like veteran suicide. We’ve addressed post-traumatic stress. We talk about the post-military healthcare system. We talk about those things that the company does to support those causes and how GDIT, through a number of our programs, is actually leading the effort in order to help veterans in a transition.” The hope is that colleagues learn that these topics are not just things you hear about on TV, but that they actually touch people's lives and, in many cases, are very close to ours. “While GDIT is a big business, when you work with a company that’s willing to invest in its employees and support employees, it takes a lot of that feeling of a big business away.” Learn more  about careers for transitioning military and veterans at GDIT.

Emerge  is designed to showcase real technology solutions, the impact they are making today, and what that impact will look like in the future. Emerge part-two focused specifically on  Emerging Technologies  and how innovation is addressing long-standing technology challenges in an exciting and accelerated fashion. The day’s  agenda  was packed with panel discussions on how these advances are changing the world of government and what’s on the horizon for agencies as they navigate this change. The event also created an opportunity for a dozen GDIT technology partners to showcase their solutions and the ways GDIT has leveraged them in support of a number of mission-critical programs. Here are five key highlights from the day: 1.  Choice is Powerful and Important Choice is Powerful and Important : GDIT’s partner ecosystem is broad and deep. More than a dozen partners joined the event to demonstrate their capabilities and talk about why they’re important to agencies in an ever-evolving technology landscape. As we have seen working with customers across the federal government, when choices are plentiful potential is infinite.

Building Cyber Resilience is Key: Building Cyber Resilience is Key:  From agency databases, to retailers, to gas pipelines – we’re all aware of the havoc a cyberattack can wreak. But cybersecurity is about more than preventing or responding to attacks; it’s about building cyber resilience that enables organizations to defend against attacks and evolve their cybersecurity postures faster than ever by using cutting-edge technology to do it. André Mendes , Chief Information Officer at the Department of Commerce, and  Tim Persons , Chief Scientist, Science, Technology Assessment, and Analytics at the Government Accountability Office talked shared first-hand accounts of how they are preparing federal systems to keep pace with evolving risks and complex technology environments. Mendes talked about how the Department of Commerce’s mission is broad and diverse. As examples, he talked about how the Census Bureau securely completed the decennial almost entirely in cloud-based environments with half a million endpoints.

And he referenced the International Trade Administration as first 100-percent cloud-based agency. All of these things depend on robust and resilient cyber frameworks which enable the agencies to be flexible and to leverage these technologies and deliver on their missions. Persons noted that things like AI, blockchain, cloud, and data analytics will soon reach the point of “general purpose technologies” where they disappear from our consciousness; meaning, we’ll take them for granted even though they are incredibly powerful technologies. We will just expect that they will be part of the landscape. In the same way, he said, cybersecurity will incorporate these technologies to build even greater resilience for agencies, infrastructure and. 3.  Virtual Has Changed Virtually Everything: Virtual Has Changed Virtually Everything:  The shift to virtual IT environments, accelerated by the pandemic, drove major workplace transformations. Agencies and integrators alike leveraged new tools and forged new partnerships in order to execute on their missions. Together, we’ve proven that we can work differently without sacrificing our ability to innovate. GDIT Vice President, Information Technology and Supply Chain and Global CIO,  Kristie Grinnell  moderated a panel discussion between  Scott Flanders , Deputy Chief Information Officer at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission;  Sanjay Gupta , Chief Technology Officer at the Small Business Administration; and  Mason McDaniel , Chief Technology Officer at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to talk about how their agencies are harnessing new technologies to innovate and power mission enablement. Gupta noted that the Small Business Administration had to depend on a variety of emerging technology solutions to support more than $1 trillion in loans and capital for small businesses in the wake of the pandemic. He noted that “necessity is the mother of all innovation,” and talked about all the ways that technology allowed the agency to stay nimble and responsive to business owners in an intense time of need and uncertainty. 4.  Collaboration Drives Innovation: Collaboration Drives Innovation:  Public and private sector partnerships are changing the game for mission delivery, showing that collaboration not only drives innovation, but sharpens and accelerates our ability to execute. GDIT Deputy Chief Information Security Officer  LaLisha Hurt  moderated a panel discussion between  Scott Blanchard , Vice President and Chief Technology Officer at General Dynamics Mission Systems;  Mark Fox , Manager for Defense Mission Programs at Amazon Web Services; and  Mark Munsell , Former Chief Technology Officer at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. On the topic of collaboration, Fox said “Commercial companies will always have the ability to build and deliver new services solutions fasters than our government customers can adopt them … it’s in our DNA.” But, he said, to get business done with federal customers, you need all three entities – government and agencies, the integrators, and the industry. Each of the three are necessary on a team, and that team will beat any team comprised of just one of the above. “We have to do this together; it can’t be done alone,” he said. 5.  The Next Generation of STEM Leaders is Here and Impressive: The Next Generation of STEM Leaders is Here and Impressive:  One of the last sessions of the day was called “Stretch Your Mind and #STEMulate.” It convened high school and college-aged students for an engaging discussion on real-world STEM topics and concepts. It featured an IT demonstration from GDIT's Avengers Internship Team, talks from STEM professionals, a super-fun trivia game, and an information-packed presentation from an early-career recruiter. We could not be more thrilled with the ways our former interns talked about their experiences at GDIT, or the level of interest from future GDIT internship candidates. The group asked interesting questions about leadership, teamwork, and communication – in addition to technology-related questions – demonstrating their readiness to be meaningful contributors to teams in lots of different ways. Their inquisitiveness and ingenuity make for a stellar combination. We know great things are ahead for them no matter where they land. To be sure, this Emerge session was a fantastic one. You don’t want to miss out on the next event, which will be the final of this year’s events. The theme for that session, held on June 23, is the Defense Cloud. Join us for a discussion on how cloud is evolving the way defense agencies defend assets, support the warfighter and gain tactical advantages. Register today !

5 Critical Considerations for Building Data-Driven Organizations,"Paul Hockel Sr. Director, Business Strategy & Data Analytics at GDIT shares 5 critical considerations for organizations looking to become truly data driven. It all starts with the mission. Transparency is extremely powerful and helps identify where your issues are and where you need to focus your energy. Be open to anomalies in your data and increase the depth and number of sources of data to become proactive and predictive rather than reactive. After collecting multiple data points over time, you will be able to become predictive in your analysis of your challenges and take actions.","TAGS TAGS DATA AND ANALYTICS  Related 3 MIN READ ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,  DATA AND ANALYTICS,  HOMELAND … SECURITY,  INTELLIGENCE Applying Geospatial Intelligence and AI/ML to the Climate Change Challenge EVENT CIVIL,  DATA AND ANALYTICS Data Driven Diplomacy 3 MIN READ DATA AND ANALYTICS,  INTELLIGENCE,  HOMELAND SECURITY Geospatial Data Cleaning: LATEST LATEST 5 Critical Considerations for Building Data- Driven Organizations By  Paul Hockel Paul Hockel Sr. Director, Business Strategy & Data Analytics July 13th, 2020 Every organization has untapped data.Five Challenges & Five Solutions 3 MIN READ DATA AND ANALYTICS,  INTELLIGENCE,  HOMELAND SECURITY Partnering with Academia to Build Geospatial Talent","datum, organization, analytic, challenge, data, mission, intelligence, question, business, customer","data organization, late critical consideration, paul hockel paul hockel sr, business strategy, data analytic, july 13th, untapped datum, well decision making, well question asking, good organization",DATA AND ANALYTICS,"LATEST LATEST 5 Critical Considerations for Building Data- Driven Organizations By  Paul Hockel Paul Hockel Sr. Director, Business Strategy & Data Analytics July 13th, 2020 Every organization has untapped data. How to leverage that data for better decision making and better question-asking can be the difference between good organizations and great ones; between staying ahead of competitors or not; between winning a major contract or losing out. The journey toward building and remaining a data-driven organization can be daunting and can leave many wondering where exactly to begin. While there is no textbook answer to this question, GDIT’s experience tackling this challenge with our customers has given us a unique insight into methodologies that enable successful data analytics implementations. From this work, we’ve identified five critical considerations for organizations looking to become truly data driven. 1. Start with the Mission It all starts with the mission.  What is the mission of your organization? What do you do? How? And why does that matter for customers and the business? By zeroing in on this question you will be better able to understand which data you should prioritize collecting and assessing in order to aid you in answering – and asking – transformational questions of the business. 2. Look for Mission Impediments Anything that stands in the way of you achieving your mission and objectives as an organization is killing you – operationally, financially, fundamentally. By better understanding what is keeping you from accomplishing your objectives you will be better able to establish mechanisms for collecting and analyzing data that helps determine if your actions are helping or hindering this process. Success doesn’t have to be complicated.  You can start small and build on each success. 3. Promote Transparency This is all about the importance of being honest about the data you find, even when it isn’t pretty. Becoming data-driven involves exposing data to a wider audience, even to your customers.  Transparency is extremely powerful – because it helps identify where your issues are and where you need to focus your energy.  Good data doesn’t lie, but change lies in first being transparent."," LATEST LATEST 5 Critical Considerations for Building Data- Driven Organizations By  Paul Hockel Paul Hockel Sr. Director, Business Strategy & Data Analytics July 13th, 2020 Every organization has untapped data.

Transparency is extremely powerful – because it helps identify where your issues are and where you need to focus your energy.  Good data doesn’t lie, but change lies in first being transparent. Transparency also helps build trust with your customers and across the organization. It signals that you are acknowledging where there are opportunities for improvement and that you have the data that will allow you to take the right, corrective actions. 4. Be Open to Anomalies Some of the best analytics projects uncover things that are outside what we expect. Why explore if you don’t expect to learn something new, right? From anomalies in our data, we can uncover new areas to analyze – new questions to ask – to get at the heart of some of the toughest challenges we have as organizations. Anomalies enable (and empower, and embolden) us to ask why and give us license to go after the answer. And those answers can sometimes be the most enlightening. 5. Increase the Breadth and Depth of What You Measure Measuring multiple sources of data over a greater period can allow you to become proactive and predictive rather than reactive. Start with one function, your most important, and then build on it.  After collecting multiple data points over time, you will be able to become predictive in your analysis of your challenges and take actions. You have intelligence in your organizations that is dying to be shared to add value to the business and help you accomplish your mission’s objectives.  Becoming a data-driven organization is a never-ending journey and it will not happen overnight.  As you solve one challenge, others will emerge. The important thing is that you start, and as you continue to solve greater challenges your organization will be improving every step of the way.

While cloud services have been tough for DoD to take advantage of due to concerns about security, the requirement to refactor workloads and reference architectures, and the perils of acquisition processes, Whitenight said “the integration of VMware into milCloud  2.0 brings all of those pieces together, making them much easier to overcome.” Whitenight went on to detail how, on the security front, the milCloud  2.0 infrastructure operates within the DoD Information Network (DoDIN) physical facilities and network boundaries. It’s also FedRAMP High Impact Level 5 certified. He went on to note that milCloud  2.0 is pre-competed and pre-approved – meaning a mission partner can use a credit card to procure cloud service in as little as 48 hours. Pretty incredible. The session also covered the underlying benefits of this new offering and its application connections; tactical use cases and product demonstrations; as well as the latest technology features that mission partner are using to meet their mission-critical needs.

ITIL Running at the Speed of Agile,"ITIL and Agile principles are aligned. Agile and ITIL are value-driven approaches that have immense benefits for organizations' missions and users. ITIL helps facilitate considered decision-making, while Agile presents a model for fast feedback loops that can accelerate and decentralize the decision making process. Technology enables the two practices to work together harmoniously. People need to have technologies that mitigate risk and allow for change. They need a culture that helps people embrace change. Leadership drives collaboration for better processes and governance and leadership to drive collaboration.

It’s an interesting – and important – question. The answer is an absolute, yes. Here’s why: The principles of the IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) and Scaled Agile Framework  (SAFe) are aligned. They’re both designed to make enterprise IT operations run more efficiently and effectively. They are value-driven approaches that have immense benefits for organizations’ missions and users. Bringing them together for customers doesn’t happen as often as it should, but it is something we’ve done a lot at GDIT. And in doing that work, we’ve gained perspective about how to combine the two platforms in ways that work for everyone. At its core, combining ITIL and SAFe is all about supporting organizations as they make informed decisions. It’s about feeding that process with information that can open up their appetite for change. ITIL helps facilitate considered decision-making, while Agile presents a model for fast feedback loops that can accelerate and decentralize the decision-making process. Of course, in practice, there are some challenges associated with asking ITIL to run at the speed of SAFe. 1. Technologies mitigate risk First, you need technologies that mitigate risk and allow for change. Often, within IT teams, mitigating risk equals inertia; but you can accomplish risk mitigation with technologies that deliver robotic process automation, machine learning, or AI, for example, that can present an appropriate risk analysis to elevate stakeholders’ awareness of impact, making them comfortable and ready to move forward with change. While SAFe promises you speed of delivery, ITIL gives you stability in your environments, with both practices incorporating security throughout the life cycle. Technology enables the two practices to work together harmoniously; real-time determination of risk associated with a change can be nothing short of transformative. 2. Culture that embraces change Second, you need a culture that helps people embrace change. Let’s be honest, sometimes people can be afraid to stick out their necks and advocate for change because if things go wrong, they’ll take the heat. ®"," LATEST LATEST ITIL Running at the Speed of Agile By  Michelle Russo, GDIT Senior Program Manager, and Andre Haynes, GDIT Program Director Michelle Russo, GDIT Senior Program Manager, and Andre Haynes, GDIT Program Director March 30th, 2021 Can ITIL run at the speed of Agile?

Culture that embraces change Second, you need a culture that helps people embrace change. Let’s be honest, sometimes people can be afraid to stick out their necks and advocate for change because if things go wrong, they’ll take the heat. ® Instead, people need to have technologies available that enable them to facilitate change in a way that allows them to anticipate and plan for changes. These tools will support their analysis and mitigate risk to their respective mission responsibilities. One successful change begets another and another, and – over time – a culture change takes root, but it all depends on being able to perform proper risk analyses and getting people comfortable. 3. Leadership drives collaboration Finally, you need governance and leadership to drive collaboration for better processes. Engineer, statistician, and management consultant Dr. W. Edwards Deming famously said, “People work in the system that management created.” What he meant by that was that people will do their best, but sometimes the systems they’re working within need to change. It’s incumbent on IT managers to champion the best approaches – or marriages of approaches in this case – that will allow their people to be successful. For teams, inefficient processes that have “grown up” within changes of the past will always be roadblocks. Removing them can make a world of difference. At the end of the day, technology should enable the right process for the organizations to make changes that make them more efficient and that allow them to repurpose people for high-function, deep-thinking, mission-critical tasks. Using ITIL and SAFe together means teams can manage legacy, virtual or future cloud-based infrastructures at the speed necessary to match the changing needs of the business – whether that change is new software, new maintenance, or other activity. While it took Agile awhile to gain its footing, the result of its maturation from a purely development focused approach to one that involves ensuring new products work in production is DevOps. The old wall between “Dev” and “Ops” was really a wall between the desire to accelerate change and keeping steady state (with security firmly in the middle). ITIL and SAFe, together, enable a DevOps and DevSecOps mindset where there is shared responsibility, relentless improvement and a healthier feedback loop that invites input from existing systems as well as customers.

Watch the full webinar and read the recap below. Cyberspace: A Shared Domain Howard opened the discussion by recognizing that the global Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted how cyberspace – among many others – is a shared domain. As nation states, we share both the risk and the reward of a strong cybersecurity posture. On the idea of sharing and collaboration, Toregas voiced support for a stronger platform for international collaboration, conceding that creating that type of platform is hard to do – even for organizations like the UN. He told the group that we need to rethink the platforms we do have and ensure that they’re working as a reflection of today’s world. The world isn’t getting any simpler, he said, and the speed with which that’s happening is cyber speed. McFadden noted that cybersecurity hinges on two words: collaboration and trust. And we need more of both. It requires nuanced partnerships, he said, as well as healthy relationships between private sector businesses that serve the government and their agency clients through which they can share information and best practices. Greater participation in partnerships is how the world will stay ahead of cyber threats. Bate pointed out that, when it comes to cybersecurity globally, we also need shared values on how we want the internet to be beyond just secure. We want it to be open, free, and interoperable, as examples. One of the best things we can do, she said, is implement the standards we advise and do so in a meaningful way from a policy perspective.

This year’s focus was on diversity in the workplace and its impact on innovation – with knowledge that the two are inextricably linked. The all-virtual nature of the event certainly felt different than in years past, but the inspiration and sense of community were the same.

The two women talked about everything from leadership and respect, to resilience and innovation. They also discussed the pandemic and its impact on women in the workforce, with one of four women leaving it as a result. Dr. Johnson described the impact of that as “undermining our equity” with a disproportionate burden put on women at home. “I say to other CEOs – do not forget about these women!

This remarkable panel of women with varied career experiences and backgrounds talked about the ways they’ve been challenged (and challenged themselves) to be their best selves at work. The group touched on the pandemic and its impact on women both in the workplace and at home; they talked about being your authentic self at work; and they discussed ways they’ve each learned how to advocate for themselves – and with confidence. It was a lively and motivating discussion that could have gone on for much longer, with tremendous nuggets of wisdom throughout. At the same time, GDIT’s Technology Director for the Homeland Security and Telecommunication Sector  Steven Oh Steven Oh  moderated a breakout session titled:  Innovate Early, Advice for Early Career Professionals . This discussion featured  Tamika Abbott Tamika Abbott , Director of the Security Technology Operations Division at the State Department;  Shaleen Braley Shaleen Braley , Senior Program Director and Program Manager at GDIT;  Heidi Landford Heidi Landford , Vice President of Enterprise Data & Analytics at Red Hat; and  Alessandra Ginante Yockelson Alessandra Ginante Yockelson , Senior Vice President, Chief Talent Officer and Global HR Leader at Hewlett Packard Enterprise. The group shared their advice on how people who are early in their careers can share their unique perspectives at work. They talked about what future leaders will look like (hint: they’ll be more diverse) and how diversity has affected their own careers. This was a can’t-miss session for early leaders and we’re so grateful to the group for sharing their perspectives. Next on the agenda was  A Conversation with GDIT President Amy Gilliland A Conversation with GDIT President Amy Gilliland . Our Director of Organizational Development, Scott Nycum Scott Nycum , sat down with Amy to talk about diversity and inclusion and the importance of allyship within our company. On that topic, she shared three important ways the pandemic has actually helped GDIT become even better at diversity and inclusion. First, she noted that the pandemic proved that we could be more flexible with our employees than we ever thought possible. Second, remote working created an ability for leaders to empower their teams and build a culture based on trust. Finally, the pandemic drove a more empathetic style of leadership, which required leaders to build relationships differently, to do more coaching of employees in virtual environments, and to really meet employees where they are. She also talked about how a diversity of background leads to diversity of thought, and how everyone at GDIT has a role in advancing and embracing diversity – whether as a leader or a team member. Everyone has a voice. And everyone should use it. Sound advice. The day’s third breakout session was called  Overcoming Bias in Artificial Intelligence  and was moderated by  Mike Wagner Mike Wagner , Senior Director, International Biometrics Account Manager at GDIT. The panelists for this discussion included  Dr. Sumeet Dua Dr. Sumeet Dua  of Louisiana Tech University;  Janice Kephart Janice Kephart  from Identity Strategy Partners; and  Catherine Tilton Catherine Tilton , GDIT’s Chief Technologist for Biometrics. During this session, the group discussed the inherent biases that all humans have that can – intentionally or unintentionally – impact AI. Panelists agreed that a lack of diversity in training data is one element at the core of the problem. Others include the availability of accurately labeled data, the cost of obtaining it, and privacy rules that are well-intended but ultimately make publicly available data less diverse. However, the group noted that there is encouraging news: researchers and industry groups are hard at work to standardize best practices and deliver solutions. The day’s fourth breakout session,  Embracing a Zero Trust Model , was moderated by GDIT’s Deputy Chief Information Security Officer,  LaLisha Hurt LaLisha Hurt  and brought together panelists  Anusha Iyer Anusha Iyer  from Corsha;  Melina Scotto Melina Scotto , GDIT’s Federal Health CISO; Rinki Sethi Rinki Sethi  from Twitter; and  Juliana Vida Juliana Vida  from Splunk. The group talked about the Zero Trust security concept, which is centered on the belief that organizations should not automatically trust anything inside or outside its perimeters and instead must verify anything and everything trying to connect to its systems before granting access. Of course, the pandemic impacted organizations’ ability to embrace such a model and required them to innovate. The conversation on innovation naturally segued to diversity and how unique perspectives foster more (and more dimensionalized) innovation. The group agreed that diversity is critical in all its forms – from race and ethnicity and gender to neurodiversity. It’s not just about bringing in more women, it’s about bringing in people with different abilities as well – and it’s not an option, it is a necessity. The day’s  EmpowHer Panel  was moderated by GDIT’s Senior Director, Inclusion, Diversity & Giving  Adrienne Alberts Adrienne Alberts . Joining her were  Darby Chellis Bade Darby Chellis Bade , our Federal Civilian Program Director;  Nikoia Greene Nikoia Greene  our Senior Director of Operations;  Lara Rivera Lara Rivera Lopez Lopez , a Senior Program Manager at GDIT; and  Leigh Palmer Leigh Palmer  GDIT Senior Vice President, Defense. Adrienne kicked off the conversation by talking about how diversity requires uncomfortable conversations and asked the panelists to share examples of how they’d addressed those conversations by traveling out of their comfort zones. This led to a discussion on inclusive leadership – what it means, how to demonstrate it, and how the panelists have worked to bring people along on their leadership journeys. The stories were inspiring and encouraging and reinforced the event’s overall theme of how diversity – most certainly – fuels innovation. The event concluded with a  Wrap-Up  from Grinnell, who closed out the event by inviting everyone to join a virtual happy hour and networking session. This was such a special event – and the best part is that you can watch all of the sessions whenever you like! Kudos to everyone involved.  We’re already looking forward to next year!

Together, we are able to accelerate and simplify the agency’s modernization efforts while also reducing risk. Low-code automation brings a faster, simpler and more user-friendly approach to the agency’s modernization efforts. For starters, it reduces the amount of traditional hand-coding necessary. This not only accelerates the development and delivery of applications, but it also reduces risk. It minimizes human error and enforces coding standards to ensure quality development. An agile development approach is also supported through low-code automation, which involves business users earlier in the development process.

An attorney in her native Sierra Leone, Ms. Atiba-Davies prosecuted a failed coup leader, only to become his number-one target when he later escaped from prison and came to power with the help of a rebel guerilla army. Forced to flee the country, separated from her children, and seeking asylum, she overcame unthinkable adversity by finding and building incredible resilience. Today, she is a powerful advocate for victims and has dedicated her career to giving them a voice – first as Principal State Counsel in Sierra Leone; then in Gambia as Deputy Director of the Office of the Public Prosecutor; and later as the Victims Expert for the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague leading its Gender and Children Unit.

The Declaration of Independence says all men are created equal and until yesterday when I checked, they haven’t revised it.” Asked how the challenges in her life had impacted her faith Asked how the challenges in her life had impacted her faith , she said they’d made it stronger and brought her closer to her faith. “It started because of the serious reflection I had on life after what happened [in Sierra Leone] in 1997. I come from a simple family but somehow, I have always found myself in positions of the limelight. Starting from school awards – to becoming a lawyer and being involved in high profile cases – that brought a false sense of ‘I can do it all; I’m it’ – but when the coup took place and things happened the way they did I was forced to reflect. And that sober reflection – I thank God – made me realize I am not in control, like I thought I was.” She went on to explain that once she realized she was not in control, she had to dig deeper, ask questions, meditate, and pray to come to the conclusion that it’s only one’s faith in God that can help you in good times and keep you grounded in dark times. As an example, Ms. Atiba-Davies recalled how As an example, Ms. Atiba-Davies recalled how , in 2001, she applied for a job at the Legal Affairs division at the Port Authority in New York. She was offered a position as Deputy to the Head of the Department but by some twist of fate, the offer was withdrawn. The position had been created because a staff member had resigned, but then withdrew her resignation. “That withdrawal of my offer was what saved me from reporting for duty on the 36th floor of Tower 1 of the World Trade Center, starting on the 10th of September. 9/11 was the next day. So, in it all, I am happy I am not in control because if I were, I would have been in that position when the towers came down.” Asked about advice she’d give to everyone Asked about advice she’d give to everyone , dealing with all that 2020 gave us (and that 2021 continues to dole out), she said, “Develop your character.” She then went on to say that she operates with three C’s in mind: character, courage, and commitment. When you’re developing your character, you’re working on things like honesty, integrity, and competence, she said. When it comes to developing your courage, she said hers was developed by being aware of the fact that she’s not in control and faith is the bedrock of that. And commitment is all about your belief in what you’re doing or want to do. Asked about why it’s especially important for women of color not to give up on their dreams or career aspirations she Asked about why it’s especially important for women of color not to give up on their dreams or career aspirations she said, simply said, simply , “We don’t have any choice.” She told the group to be open to, in some cases, not giving up on your goals but maybe suspending them. “Maybe you put them on hold – and that was part of my journey,” she said. She told the group about how she was so disappointed when she came to America and wanted to practice law but learned she’d first have to get an undergraduate degree, then go to law school, then take the bar. “That was out of the question,” she said, “I had children to feed, children to support!” So, she instead put her interests to one side and focused on raising her children. “Sometimes you have to sacrifice and make sure that it’s for the greater good. The sacrifice of doing that, in my mind, was for their good.” Of course, Ms. Atiba-Davies found immense success as an advocate for victims, though she was no longer practicing law. “You know there’s something you’re working for; you’re becoming more prepared to get to the next level. So, you should never be daunted by people who encourage you to give it up or try something else. You’re the best person to make that decision but be real with yourself. Don’t pursue false hopes or dreams so you can be in competition with someone. Let it come from within. You know your ability. You know what’s inside of you, so hold on to that and let the best come out of it,” she said. Asked about finding the strength to persevere Asked about finding the strength to persevere , knowing she could be prosecuted or even killed, she said, “Somebody has to do what’s right; and if it has to be me, so be it.” A pretty incredible way to end the conversation and the session. Thank you for your time and insights, Ms. Atiba-Davies. We are in awe and so inspired by you! Learn more about  GDIT Diversity and Inclusion .

But there’s a larger reason for adjusting course. Agencies are also reaching an inflection point, at which it’s become critical for federal officials focus more fully on their hybrid cloud journey. Those who’ve already made the leap to the cloud have learned, perhaps the hard way, that each of the major cloud service providers has its own unique strengths and operating requirements. But to fully leverage the power and capabilities of the cloud, it’s crucial that agencies and their components take a step back to make sure they truly understand their data strategies first — and then determine which cloud is best suited to their needs, and why. It’s equally importantly that agencies understand what they’re going to be doing in the cloud once they get there — and, longer term, how they plan to integrate the outcomes back into their operations. If you don’t make those decisions properly up front, chances are, your data may very well end up in the wrong cloud. As the global CIO at GDIT — a company that has a long history of working with government agencies — I’ve experienced those lessons first hand as we went through our own cloud journey. And I’ve come to appreciate they’re particularly important for federal agencies. Today, GDIT uses a combination of cloud service providers as well as our own, significantly consolidated, on-prem data centers to meet our infrastructure and platform needs. There are several reasons we opted to work with multiple cloud providers. One basic reason was to prevent vendor lock-in. But more importantly, it also was to make sure we were able to manage our data in the most appropriate environments. And of course, having the right level of security has always been a monumental concern with our agency customers. So is how our thousands of employees and engineers interact with agencies and that data every day. That journey began by developing a playbook to systematically review our data requirements and determine which cloud services were best-suited to our, and our customers’ needs, including a heavy emphasis on security assurances. We then tested direct connections to respective cloud providers and developed containers to see what worked best. Finally, we moved full speed ahead to take advantage of all that cloud has to offer, including AI and ML, automation, scalability and greater analytic capabilities."," LATEST LATEST Unlocking the Power of the Cloud By  Kristie Grinnell Kristie Grinnell Vice President, Information Technology and Supply Chain and Chief Information Officer February 8th, 2021 Challenges over the past year have forced federal agencies to reconsider their strategic IT road maps.

We then tested direct connections to respective cloud providers and developed containers to see what worked best. Finally, we moved full speed ahead to take advantage of all that cloud has to offer, including AI and ML, automation, scalability and greater analytic capabilities. Starting with the right questions What we learned along the way, though, is that the technical hurdles moving to different clouds are only part of the challenge. A critical question becomes, do you have sufficient talent to get you there — and the right mix of people who understand what’s involved, how different clouds work and the gaps in between? One reason federal agencies continue to turn to GDIT, for instance, is the breadth and depth of experience among our 14,000- plus cleared professionals — including more than 3,000 cloud specialists supporting federal and state/local government. Our teams have helped set up more than 60,000 different cloud instances across multiple cloud service providers, including AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, IBM and Oracle. And we currently work with more than 50 cloud partners. With every engagement, we began by asking: “What type of data do you have? How sensitive is it? What do you want to do with it when you get there? Who needs access to it?” The other big challenge is the organizational change required — helping people to understand the rationale for change and their role in the future state. We know because we’ve got scars on our back from our own cloud journey — as well as through our experience partnering with agencies as they went through similar transitions. Building on experience Collectively, we’ve learned the more scale you have, the more automation you need —  whether you’re modernizing on-prem or in the cloud — and that can shift the roles and workloads throughout an organization. That’s where the benefits of experience can help. At the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which operates one of the largest public clouds in the federal government, we have been providing cloud services for the past five years and recently won a new contract for up to an additional four more years.  GDIT is standardizing multi-cloud environments for CMS  and will implement a range of cloud services, cloud training, tools and software and simplify the financial management of cloud services. In another example,  GDIT helped the Defense Department  establish a fit-for-purpose, self-service commercial cloud service within DOD’s network and facilities. By providing critical security controls, including IL-5 security standards (IL-6 coming soon), plus the ability to procure cloud services within in hours, rather than the traditional 16-to-18 month acquisition cycle, DOD mission partners can fast-track the use of AI and ML applications and other emerging solutions. Our cloud specialists also have a unique understanding of what’s involved in rolling out cloud services at scale. That’s one reason GDIT was awarded a contract to help improve  information sharing and collaboration  across the DOD with the largest-ever deployment of Microsoft Office 365, to more than 3.2 million users. What those and countless other projects have taught us is the fundamental importance of constantly re-skilling and up-upskilling of your workforce, in order to take advantage of all the changes and services that the big cloud providers keep rolling out. Our extensive relationships with all of the major cloud providers, the many partners they work with, and our agnostic approach to finding the right solutions for agencies, are among just some of reasons why federal agencies continue to see the advantage of engaging GDIT’s experts to help them capitalize on the cloud faster and more effectively. Five years from now, chances are, we won’t be talking much anymore about transitioning to the cloud. Instead, we’ll be talking about all the ways government agencies are leveraging their data using the power of the cloud. But that vision depends on getting your data and cloud strategies properly mapped out today — and having the right talent in place to help you.

She recalls how, growing up in the small town of Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, there were essentially two paths for women: going to college or becoming a farmer’s wife. Julie’s mom didn’t have the money to send her to college and Julie had no desire to become a farmer’s wife, so she joined the military, specifically, the Women’s Army Corps. This was at the end of the Vietnam War era when there were only about 500 women in the Army in total. Among the other 60-women in her unit, Julie found her stride and charted her own path. She served for 22 years at posts in Texas, Germany and Washington, D.C., eventually rising to the rank of E8 Master Sergeant (MSG) and making significant contributions at every turn. “I worked at the Army Burn Unit on a research team which led to a patent for the Silvadene Burn Cream which is still in use today,” she said. “I also ran a blood bank in Germany for a neonatal unit that was responsible supplying fresh blood for these tiny one or two-pound babies being born there.” Julie was also running the blood bank in Germany during the Ramstein air show disaster in 1988, which at the time was the deadliest air show accident in history. It was a mass casualty event with 70 fatalities and hundreds of serious injuries, surely a day Julie will never forget. GDIT is fortunate to have had Julie among our ranks for more than 20 years. Following her service, Julie says joining GDIT was a natural choice. She loves her country and wants to continue supporting the military mission, which she does every day on the Military Health Life Sciences program. This initiative is focused on helping to research, educate, diagnose, and treat the healthcare issues affecting our service members, veterans, and their families. “When I was on active duty, we focused on esprit de corps (a feeling of pride, fellowship and common loyalty shared by the members of a particular group) and in my GDIT organization, we really promote camaraderie and the notion of success for all – no lone rangers. We’re like a family or even a unit,” she shared. Like many who join the military young, Julie had some doubts about joining the civilian workforce upon retirement. “When I went to retire, I doubted my skills, but the military absolutely did prepare me for this job,” she said. “The mission does change but the military taught me time management, people skills and it instilled in me the love of country and the urge to protect our country.”"," LATEST LATEST Continuing the Military Mission at GDIT By  GDIT GDIT March 17th, 2021 Julie McGrath, Vice President of GDIT's Julie McGrath, Vice President of GDIT's  Military Health Life Sciences program, has always been a trailblazer.

It was a mass casualty event with 70 fatalities and hundreds of serious injuries, surely a day Julie will never forget. GDIT is fortunate to have had Julie among our ranks for more than 20 years. Following her service, Julie says joining GDIT was a natural choice. She loves her country and wants to continue supporting the military mission, which she does every day on the Military Health Life Sciences program. This initiative is focused on helping to research, educate, diagnose, and treat the healthcare issues affecting our service members, veterans, and their families. “When I was on active duty, we focused on esprit de corps (a feeling of pride, fellowship and common loyalty shared by the members of a particular group) and in my GDIT organization, we really promote camaraderie and the notion of success for all – no lone rangers. We’re like a family or even a unit,” she shared. Like many who join the military young, Julie had some doubts about joining the civilian workforce upon retirement. “When I went to retire, I doubted my skills, but the military absolutely did prepare me for this job,” she said. “The mission does change but the military taught me time management, people skills and it instilled in me the love of country and the urge to protect our country.” The military also prepared Julie to be a strong leader and manager. “Leadership is the art of influencing people to do what they would not normally do themselves,” she said. “But I also rolled up my sleeves and did things alongside my soldiers. I apply that same leadership style now. The military gave me skills for my entire life,” she said. We agree, Julie.  First, we thank you for your service. And second, we thank you for being a valued member of the GDIT team. Learn more about the  Military Health Life Sciences Program .

Asked about what the future might look like, the panelists nearly all pointed to data and managing data workflows and being able to leverage data to advance missions and spur innovation. Brigadier General Raduege said, in his view, the future is going to be about mobility and accessing data and securing it. He noted that users of all kinds have an appetite to access more and more data, faster and faster. As we go mobile, he said, our attack surface is getting bigger and broader. As a result, he and his team spend a lot of time looking at security and what the future state needs to be, examining things like ZeroTrust architectures, as an example. “Data is the fuel which powers innovation, which is the mechanism we will use to drive all the advances that we’re looking forward to,” said Greer. “It’s the new weapons system that allows our warfighters to be more adept and agile and bring new capabilities to theaters that benefit them.” He went on to note that we absolutely need diverse voices in the collection and use of data. Doing that will allow the data to fuel innovation even more effectively, he said, because we’ll be bringing a diversity of thought into how we look at and analyze data. Kinnard, with the Department of Labor, agreed. She noted that agencies can sometimes be data rich, but information poor.

Kinnard, with the Department of Labor, agreed. She noted that agencies can sometimes be data rich, but information poor. In an ideal state you’d have different agencies with different priorities able to access data and make decisions, she said. “Our number one priority is supporting workers,” she said. “We need to assure them that we have the data infrastructure to protect, secure and evaluate [their] data. When we leverage it to build a model or do automation, we want to guarantee [positive] ethical impacts and that our datasets represent what America looks like, and that we are having a responsible impact with the data that we have.” Asked about effective collaboration and what that will look like in the future, Younkers said, “In the context of what we learned this last year… we’ve all figured out how to work and move forward in virtual environments using collaborative tools.” He then cited tools and technologies that can make our interactions even better than they would have been in person – things like getting information on people you’re interacting with as you’re interacting with them, real-time transcription, or actioning things from a meeting. “We all spend too much time in meetings,” he said. “What if you could turn a meeting into a list of actionable items that get folded into busines processes, for example.” These are simple things that we could do, he continued, and in this new construct, collaboration tools can actually become richer. “We don’t need in-person interaction to have rich engagements,” he said. Brigadier General Raduege agreed. He said COVID forced a cultural change that has been eye-opening. “I believed in in-person engagements and saw value in them. Now, I see the value of virtual collaboration – coordinating across time zones and locations and geographies.” “We were thrust into COVID response,” he continued. “But now we have an opportunity to take huge steps forward. It’s no longer about setting a 20-year vision, it’s about challenging the paradigm and experimenting quickly and then responding to that and incrementally getting better.” In that vein, asked about driving change, Kinnard said, “The old days of ‘gather requirements, build, implement, and throw it over the wall’ are gone.” She pointed to two critical changes that are welcomed and having great effect: human-centered design and responsible implementation. Both, she said, are about bringing technologists closer to the people within an agency who really understand its mission so that they can partner together to assess the impact of new technologies and innovations. Asked about governance and organizational change and what industry can do to bring about partnerships, Younkers said, “Industry needs to continue to lean in and collaborate; it’s no longer about industry building things that the government buys and then figures out how to use.” Greer agreed. “Industry needs to be more authentic, more clear. Stop bundling things into a single bucket and be clear about how we apply domain expertise around government. We shouldn’t be just technologists. We need to understand missions and be domain experts within our technology roles.” Rounding out the discussion, Brigadier General Raduege said. “We can learn from our industry partners. Show us the art of the possible, continue to innovate and show us where we can go.” He continued, “It’s the dialogue afterward that helps us figure out how to reduce layers, reduce complexity and reduce churn in the IT products that are out there and get us to home.” Didn’t get to attend today’s event?

The symposium, held last week, consisted of a series of keynotes and panel discussions that examined the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s efforts to foster women leaders. Speakers discussed the impact of female leadership on the agency, the obstacles women have had to overcome in security- related fields, and best practices for creating a diverse and inclusive workforce.

Specifically, she talked about how during the coronavirus pandemic, the company was able to move swiftly and ably to provide continuous support to DHS, largely as a result of prior investments in digital modernization and infrastructure that helped us transition 60% of our workforce to virtual work environments in just 48 hours. “This enabled us to continue to take care of our customers, recognizing that each one has different issues and environments,” she said. “This pandemic really highlighted the need for cloud technologies, information security and data privacy – because that’s what allowed us to support customers as they accelerated the pace of development, procurement and deployment of the technologies that support their mission. For us, that’s what it’s all about – it’s all about the partnership and being there for them.” The group also talked about the importance of inclusion and the ways in which it will contribute to even more female leadership within DHS. To that end, Katharine was able to talk about the ways GDIT does exactly that. “For us, it starts at the top,” she said “Our president, Amy Gilliland, is very visible and engaged on diversity and inclusion efforts across the company… We have invested in trainings and in supporting our Employee Resource Groups, which are voluntary,"," LATEST LATEST Celebrating Women in Homeland Security By  GDIT GDIT March 9th, 2021 Heading into Women’s History Month, GDIT was exceptionally pleased to have participated in the Homeland Security & Defense Forum’s virtual symposium, titled  Celebrating Women in Homeland Security .

Cybersecurity in the government cloud  was just one recent conversation between Melina Scotto, GDIT’s Federal Health Chief Information Security Officer, and Ravi Raghava, Chief Cloud Strategist for GDIT's Federal Civilian Division. Security is a paramount concern for every government organization seeking to migrate their data or infrastructure into the cloud. Whether you’re looking to move to the cloud or you’re already there, the five best practices they shared for securing the cloud are a must. 1. Assess security controls FedRAMP is an authorization process through which the U.S. federal government provides a seal of approval to cloud service providers who comply with a stringent set of cloud security best practices. The program was first rolled out in a December 2011 memorandum from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). All federal executive offices, departments, and agencies must use a FedRAMP-compliant vendor when storing federal data in the cloud. System owner and hybrid controls should be well-documented and tested. In order to work with a cloud service provider, federal agencies must implement the cloud service provider’s (CSP) security plan and receive authorization to operate in the CSP’s environment. Achieving this  ATO (Authority to Operate)  may take between several months to a year, depending on the complexity of the environment and the FIPS-199 level of the data. 2. Encryption at rest Cloud data must be encrypted both in transit (moving between the customer and the cloud) and at rest (in persistent storage) and in use (compute).

Storage as a service offerings from public cloud providers such as Azure, AWS, and Google all include the capability to encrypt your data at rest. Enabling encryption at rest is as simple as checking a box to turn it on. Depending on the provider, the cost of encryption at rest may be included or supplementary. 3. Monitoring and scanning FedRAMP requires cloud service providers to perform  continuous monitoring (ConMon)  in order to detect threats and vulnerabilities in the environment. This requirement has not changed from on-premise systems, which also require monitoring and scanning. However, the tools and techniques for monitoring and scanning do vary between the cloud and on-premises. The defenses available to protect your cloud environment include: Web application firewalls (WAFs) Web application firewalls (WAFs) : Web application firewalls monitor, filter, and block the HTTP traffic to and from a website or web application. In so doing, WAFs impede the flow of potentially harmful traffic that may be hunting for vulnerabilities in your environment. Logging Logging : Logging software is a crucial best practice for cloud IT security: it records events and transactions in your environment, including possible red flags. Security administrators can use these logs to reconstruct events and identify attempted intrusions. Incident management Incident management : When unexpected events disrupt your operations, incident management helps keep your business up and running while the response team finds and fixes the root cause. Antivirus software Antivirus software : Antivirus and antimalware software scans your files and data at regular intervals, detecting threats such as spyware, ransomware, and Trojan horses. Penetration testing Penetration testing : Penetration testing simulates a cyber attack on your cloud environment in order to uncover and fix security flaws. Auditing Auditing : Comprehensive security audits provide the peace of mind that your choice of cloud service provider has the appropriate controls to safeguard your environment. 4. Metering and alerting Your cloud management console is an attack vector of its own. Malicious actors who can access your management console or hypervisor can spin up hundreds or thousands of cloud servers for their own nefarious purposes, all on the federal dime. To prevent this abuse of your compute resources, construct meaningful metering and alerting systems that will detect and inform you of suspicious activity early.  Multi-factor authentication (MFA)  also helps block unauthorized users by requiring multiple methods of verifying your identity. Using metering and alerting is invaluable—not just for security, but also to control expenses and prevent accidental overuse of cloud resources. An estimated  $14.1 billion in cloud spending  will be wasted this year due to idle resources and overprovisioning. The benefit of the cloud is that you can adjust usage up and down as needed automatically, giving you flexibility and scalability. 5. Evaluating vendors carefully Many cloud vendors will tell you they are FedRAMP ready or just shy of authorization, while the reality is altogether different. Finding the right vendor for the government cloud will require you to cut through the sales language and evaluate their true state of readiness. The  FedRAMP Ready designation  indicates that a cloud service provider has been deemed ready for FedRAMP authorization by an accredited third-party assessment organization (3PAO). This 3PAO evaluates the provider and completes a readiness assessment. If successful, the provider earns the title of FedRAMP Ready and can move to the next step of FedRAMP authorization. Be wary of vendors who claim that they are ready for the cloud. Perform your due diligence, and assume the attitude of “trust, but verify.” Always make sure that your choice of government cloud vendor is as ready to work with you as you are with them.

You want to modernize your agency by moving to the  cloud  and deliver mission solutions faster while driving savings and improving security. With so many approaches and providers available, where do you start? A key consideration before you even begin your strategy and planning is your cloud economics:how and why you are going to spend your allotted funding? And what are the potential barriers that can slow down the migration project? Once you're clear on these two elements, you'll be better prepared to address the challenge of following fairly rigid government processes to obtain what are often very fluid cloud computing assets. 'Economics' means more than 'money' As a federal agency leader, your economic decisions encompass both financial considerations as well as the value received in exchange for your investment. You recognize that low-cost doesn't always mean economical if its value fails to achieve your agency’s primary mission. High cost doesn't always mean expensive if it provides better value and a higher return for your investment. All of these considerations are significant as you contemplate how your agency will adopt the Cloud Smart strategy. You need to establish a project budget that covers all the necessary aspects of cloud, but if you've never procured cloud services before, you may not know what all of those aspects are, nor how to estimate their cost. And you'll need to justify your project budget by providing a high-quality return, so capturing and accounting for all costs is imperative to the project's success.

Barriers that threaten cloud adoption economics Two federal agency realities pose unique problems to maximizing your investment: government procurement processes and culture. Each must be considered and accounted for as part of the overall project to meet both the budget and the project's timelines. Entrenched procurement systems The Cloud Smart strategy is compelling many federal leaders to change how they think about the procurement process as they strategize a cloud migration project. Rather than simply asking about price, they're now evaluating their project economics through an 'efficiency' lens: ""What more can I accomplish with my investment?"" rather than ""How much volume can I afford to buy?"" Further, because cloud computing services aren't traditional 'assets,' you can't buy them the same way you'd buy a tangible asset. Instead, you'll need to consider multiple variables that come into play in a cloud migration project, then build funding for those variables into your procurement request: Assess agency systems. Assess agency systems.  Your existing workflows were designed to achieve agency objectives. You'll need to know how those workflows create your agency systems so you can duplicate them or improve on them in the cloud configuration. This analysis takes time. Align Services and Features to Needs. Align Services and Features to Needs.  The cloud offers an almost unlimited selection of unique services and features, each of which will be tailored to address your organization's individual use cases and functions. Choosing those will require inputs from and notifications to not just your architects and engineers, but also your procurement, contract, and pricing departments. Your budget requirements will change based on how you elect to configure and implement your newly acquired cloud assets. Appraise current practices to cloud-specific opportunities. Appraise current practices to cloud-specific opportunities.  The cloud introduces concepts that, traditionally, most organizations have not had to consider. Many cloud tools can be configured to perform more than one function, and your opportunity to extend the productivity of your cloud assets across multiple departments may also positively impact your budget and purchasing power. Cultural challenges Long-standing cultural norms also pose significant challenges. Understanding and addressing those should be  the first step in the cloud migration project , according to Michael Fairless, branch chief of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Cloud computing will disrupt not just how work gets done, but also how whole systems will function, and its implementation will require many workers to learn new concepts as well as new skills. Further, many agencies are organized as a series of silos, each with individual barriers to improving overall agency functioning. Security and compliance concerns can also trigger fears if staffers aren't aware of how cloud computing offers better opportunities to master both. Addressing “all-in” costs The Cloud Smart challenge mandates that federal agency leaders rethink how they procure and implement new agency assets. Consequently, estimating  the total cost of procuring cloud computing services  to achieve agency objectives should include both an analysis of the cloud's potential to improve workflows and address security concerns (addressing the Smart Cloud objectives), and the 'all-in' costs of modifying current functioning to achieve those gains. These 'all-in' costs include the time and money it will take to identify and address the economic and cultural challenges that will arise as every federal agency moves toward cloud computing. The actual number of preparation requirements needed before a cloud migration can occur varies based on agency needs and expectations. In addition to these unique ‘federal agency’ challenges, you’ll want to consider in more detail how your agency may (or may not) adapt to the cloud, how you can structure your procurement strategy, and how to ensure your budget includes everything you need to make the migration project a success. These cloud economics topics will be explored in future latest entries.

Better security does not necessarily mean more tools. It means making efficient and effective use of the best tools available. At GDIT, we’ve built a cloud-focused security stack from market-leading components to meet the Secure Cloud Computing Architecture (SCCA) requirements set by the Defense Information Security Agency. That, too, is experience at work. When we helped one customer reduce the number of cybersecurity tools they were using, analysts were able to shift more time to critical problems and focused on more proactive threat hunting. They were spending less time maintaining disparate toolsets. The bigger payoff: improved cyber posture and fewer cyber incidents. With new systems, experience saves time and effort in the race to earn the all-important authority to operate (ATO). Whether it’s assessing security controls or mapping out your security plan, we can get that work done faster because it’s something we do all the time. We’ve gained experience navigating hybrid and on-premise multi-cloud solutions wrapped in a common security stack and leveraging containers. Since we aren’t reinventing the wheel, the steps move more quickly. Finally, there’s the question of scale. Enterprise solutions eliminate duplicative spending and enhance overall effectiveness. Rather than have separate solutions in each enclave or sub-agency, leaders should seek to scale solutions to support all those customers, providing the same level of security and cyber awareness across all those domains. Adopting cloud services on that kind of scale takes vision and determination, but we are past the point where this is novel. Today’s solutions are proven and understood. What agency leaders need to do is focus on the fundamentals: Resilience. The more resilient you can make your architecture on Day 1, the fewer issues you’ll see in operations later on. Tools. Select foundational tools that give you broad situational awareness for your platform. Moving to the cloud does not outsource responsibility for understanding what’s happening on your systems. Automate. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are better suited to tracking system traffic and data logs than humans. That will free up your security analysts to dig into the big problems. Today’s cloud offers a plethora of choices, many of them confusing. We frequently see initial forays into cloud that aren’t resilient and don’t scale well – and must be reengineered to be resilient and efficient. Implementing a secure cloud solution is a process, more like building a car from a kit than driving one off the lot. All it takes is one mistake and your whole system can become vulnerable. An experienced partner is essential to the process.

To be successful, you’ve also got to be reliable, resilient and secure. Securing engineering software to be secure—especially in the cloud—is one of the biggest challenges facing government agencies. It’s not that success is so elusive, but rather that modern methods pose particular challenges to the government’s conventional ways of doing business. Agile processes and delivery—i.e., iterative improvements using a series of continuous, rapid releases—is now widely recognized as a better way to develop software. Agility allows for evolving requirements and unanticipated changes, rather than forcing government customers to lock down all possible requirements ahead of time. The lesson from Netflix, though, is that agility only takes you so far. In the cloud, systems must also be resilient in the face of outages and surprise service interruptions. Netflix executives realized that if their systems weren’t engineered for resilience from Day 1, it was just a matter of time before disaster struck. The problem was finding a way to test for resilience. Today’s consumers take using the cloud and streaming video for granted. But just a few years ago, when Netflix was transitioning from its own physical infrastructure to the cloud, company leaders worried that users would flee the service if streaming video proved unreliable. They needed a way to ensure the system was resilient enough that users could still access their content, even if portions of the cloud infrastructure failed. The solution: “chaos engineering.” By randomly shutting down parts of the infrastructure, Netflix engineers found they could discover weaknesses and engineer solutions before disaster struck. “Since no single component can guarantee 100% uptime (and even the most expensive hardware eventually fails), we have to design a cloud architecture where individual components can fail without affecting the availability of the entire system,” the company wrote on its  blog  in 2011. “In effect, we have to be stronger than our weakest link.” Today, using chaos engineering to ensure system resilience is widely practiced by the likes of Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft, among many others. But why stop there? Why not apply chaos engineering to security, as well?

Aaron Rinehart, chief enterprise security architect at United Health Group, raised this issue recently in a  post  on OpenSource.com, writing that “Security Chaos Testing has shifted our thinking about the root cause of many of our notable security incidents and data breaches.” Instead of following a conventional “set it and forget it” security model, he now sees the need to “execute on continuous instrumentation and validation of security capabilities.” Indeed, noting the “usefulness” of Security Chaos Engineering, the influential website, Thoughtworks, recently elevated the concept to the next stage on its Technology Radar. At General Dynamics Information Technology, we believe that same usefulness can greatly benefit our government customers. Most government agencies use static application scanning at several stages to test and ensure systems are free of vulnerabilities and secure from cyberattacks. But static scanning tests your application code in isolation from your actual installation. It can’t anticipate the dynamic behavior of the application itself. This is a critical issue, because as any software security expert knows, security vulnerabilities are often built on top of each other. An attacker seeking to penetrate a system will seek to exploit a feature that, taken alone, is not a security vulnerability, but through careful manipulation, may ultimately provide a means to break into the system. This kind of activity, as well as other environment-related issues, can’t be caught through static testing, because it depends on the dynamic environment in which the system operates. Because Security Chaos Engineering tests the application in its production environment, it can identify problems that other kinds of testing will miss, such as issues with load balancers, network configurations and communications with other systems. By applying one hypothesis after another, engineers can test applications while the system is running and mimic attackers operating from the outside by launching attacks to exploit timing delays and seams between systems that would otherwise be almost impossible to identify. Static testing is ideal for known vulnerabilities within the application, and closing those security gaps is essential. But to stay ahead of ever-more-agile attackers, Security Chaos Engineering can help us identify vulnerabilities in the environment the application is running in, highlighting weaknesses that weren’t known or anticipated. As a result, we can close loopholes before they’re ever discovered by attackers. At GDIT, we embrace the concept of continuous security and believe it is the future of secure software development, working at the speed of DevOps. Leveraging the Chaos Engineering principles pioneered by Netflix for resilience and by Aaron Rinehart for security adds an important building block for end-to-end security and can help ensure that government applications in the cloud will be secure, reliable and nimble enough to adapt to changing needs and threats.

4 Benefits of Moving to Software-Defined Networking,"Software-Defined Networking (SDN) provides better reliability, efficiency and cost-savings for organizations. SDN allows engineers to re-route networks on the fly. It also gives engineers the operational ability to normalize traffic across a wide space and to do it quickly and seamlessly.

It sounds crazy to say, but traditional networking, as we often think about it, is largely a thing of the past. Cloud computing, remote working, multi-device management – they all require us to approach networking entirely differently. What used to be about two computers “talking” to each other, is now about facilitating constant, real-time information sharing – on a massive scale, across devices that are rarely (if ever) in the same building. Enter Software-Defined Networking, or SDN, which together with innovations in networking infrastructure is enabling modern, efficient, reliable workplaces (and workforces), as well as just every facet of our online lives these days. In the simplest terms, SDN provisions, monitors and manages networks. Though it can instantiate networking functions in software on commonly available hardware, it is no substitute for good network design. Together, good network design and SDN can give network engineers practically unlimited creative freedom in developing new networking functions or innovations. Below are four benefits of moving to SDN for your organization to consider. 1. Greater Reliability via Automation SDN is a great option for large, complex networks that require lots of up-time. It gives engineers the ability to re-route networks on the fly. For example, when an outage occurs, a software defined network can be configured to automatically reroute around that area and maintain the connections your users need. 2. More Efficient Network Management SDN offers real-time visibility into your network performance. This visibility gives you the ability to optimize your network’s performance and to drive its efficiency (as well as that of your team’s)."," LATEST LATEST 4 Benefits of Moving to Software-Defined Networking By  Mike Cole Mike Cole Chief Technology Officer, Federal Civilian  September 15th, 2020 Networking has left the building.

Because SDN offers the real-time ability to automatically reroute or to stand-up new functions and routes, you can increase your nines of uptime without adding new hardware and increasing costs. 4. Faster Scalability SDN offers automated scaling-up (and scaling down). This ability, combined with the additional visibility it brings, gives engineers the operational ability to normalize traffic across a wide space, and to do it quickly and seamlessly. SDN brings all sorts of benefits to the table. Understanding what it can do for your organization is critical; and so is understanding what it can’t. As with anything, good design and effective management win the day. But if you’re looking for an opportunity to improve your network’s performance and to cut costs, SDN may be the way to go.

AI even helps us build applications and analyze data more rapidly. Ultimately, AI is automating repetitive decision-making and large-scale pattern recognition at scales, speeds, and accuracies unachievable by humans. But most of that would not be happening so rapidly without the cloud. What AI owes to the cloud The cloud offers three critical ingredients needed for successful AI. First, the cloud offers economical, elastic infrastructure to run machine learning algorithms. Cloud infrastructure includes virtual servers loaded with very large amounts of memory for machine learning algorithms; GPU servers ideal for parallel processing needed for deep learning; servers optimized with high network throughput for rapid application of models to real-time data; servers with high performance computing (HPC) features to support extensive modeling and simulation; and additional hardware configurations like Field Programmable Gate Arrays that are also optimized for parallel processing algorithms. Second, the cloud offers an ever-increasing set of AI algorithms and tools for building AI solutions—and it offers them through services that cloud service providers are continuously updating and improving. This includes services for data ingestion, data transformation, data visualization, AI, machine learning and deep learning. In addition, the leading cloud providers offer data science virtual machine images pre-loaded with the powerful, open source data science and machine learning tools and frameworks used by experienced data scientists to innovate. Recently, cloud service providers have even expanded their tools to include AI services (machine learning as-a-service, predictive modeling as-a-service) and self-service tools that allow traditional developers and data analysts to innovate with AI methods without years of AI and Data Science experience. And third, there’s data—the lifeblood for machine learning algorithms. Not all data comes from the cloud, but a lot is stored in the cloud—easily accessible in curated datasets ideal for training algorithms. Cloud providers host very large public data sets, many of them with labels ideal for training and comparing AI algorithms. Without the cloud, the advanced AI solutions entering the marketplace today simply wouldn’t be possible. And the tools that cloud providers are offering are opening the door for more innovation across the federal government, and its industry partners. What we’re doing with AI and the cloud Companies are using the AI services and Data Science tools available in the cloud to develop pilots that illustrate the value of automation across the civil, defense, and intelligence areas. We’ve used predictive modeling tools like the Amazon Machine Learning Service to predict which public water systems would violate safe drinking rules on chloroform in the wake of precipitation events. We’ve used Azure Machine Learning Studio to predict which automakers submitted incorrect gas mileage estimates. We’ve used Google Deep Learning APIs to recognize images. And we’ve used dozens of machine learning libraries available in the R and Python programming languages available in the AWS, Azure, and Google data science virtual machines to help the government with other mission critical tasks. The future is AI, and the cloud eases the building and deploying of AI point solutions, as well as enterprise-class solutions. Industry partners like General Dynamics IT are excited about the potential of AI and the cloud, and are committed to using the AI tools available in the cloud to develop the solutions that revolutionize the way the government operates.

Hackers can exploit fax software by delivering malware disguised as an incoming color fax.  When the incoming image file is opened, the malware installs itself, gaining access to everything else on the network besides. That wasn’t as much a concern when faxes were hooked up to stand-alone phone lines, but now that they’re tightly integrated with networks and Internet-based phone systems, the risks are significant. The lesson here isn’t that you can’t use faxes. It’s that everything we introduce to our information environment brings with it a set of risks. Reverse engineering every piece of hardware and software before we put it on the network isn’t feasible. But we can mitigate those risks through employing policies and settings, isolating systems from parts of the network, and blocking others from accessing the network entirely. For printers, that may mean disabling the fax function on that all-in-one printer and installing a stand-alone fax with a dedicated phone line for those instances when you really must send a fax. Our mobile phones are also vulnerable. One new attack vector uses ThinSIM technology to track or redirect calls. ThinSIM are like standard mobile phone SIM cards, only they live on top of the standard SIM and work by intercepting communication between the phone and the SIM card. The technology is frequently used in emerging economies to support mobile money transfers. For Western users, the risk is that a ThinSIM is placed inside your phone without your knowledge. Because the technology is designed to intercept communication between the phone and the SIM, it could be used secretly capture communications from the mobile device, or even to alter communications under some circumstances. The risk intensifies in foreign locations. Technology isn’t our only vulnerability, of course. DEF CON also highlighted human frailties. In a social-engineering competition, for example, we listened in as participants demonstrated how easily they could connect with unsuspecting corporate help desk staff, then coax them to let down their defenses and violate simple security policies, like pulling out their personal phones to open up a web page. It was a powerful reminder that phishing attacks play on human weakness and they aren’t only embedded in emails. In today’s world, security threats come from many angles. Security strategy must therefore have many facets. Organizations will always have to defend networks and systems, and no system is 100 percent safe on its own. But our greatest weaknesses are not always the fault of our systems or architectures or policies, but rather are the result of simple human weakness. Our security is ultimately only as good as the vigilance of those who use and operate our systems and who follow – or fail to follow – our policies. Hackers remember that. We must remember it, as well.

Attack Surface, Workforce Trends Building Demand for Cyber Automation Tech A confluence of trends – including ever-mounting cyber attacks, expanding network attack surfaces stemming from increased teleworking during the coronavirus pandemic, and an enduring shortage of skilled cybersecurity workforce talent – is creating demand for more autonomous cybersecurity technologies. The good news for Federal government IT is the parallel between the need for more automation in cybersecurity and the efforts in developing machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. Those are the foundational technologies integral to making machines shoulder more of the basic workload in cyber defense, while freeing up human capital to do the more advanced labor. A Problem of Numbers There’s nothing new about the need for cybersecurity; for as long as IT networks have provided services, they have been under attack by adversaries seeing disruption and monetary gains. But as networks – and attackers – have become more sophisticated, the sheer number of attacks has created a problem that often outstrips its ability to handle adversaries quickly and efficiently by human-only means. Enter autonomous cybersecurity. Simply put, automated cyber defense harnesses advanced technologies like ML and AI to detect and analyze millions of points of cyber threat data. The goal is to automate responses to as many of those as possible, while steering thornier threats to the finite resources of human cyber defenders. Deploying this technology allows for a stronger perimeter, better management of automated patches, more awareness around cyber occurrences, and improved monitoring of endpoints. Attack Metrics Surging, Surfaces Expanding With annual Federal  cybersecurity spending  reaching $17 billion in FY2020, the government is devoting large resources to address network defense problems. And in FY2019, according to the Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB) latest  report to Congress , the government reported improved cyber defense metrics, which saw an eight percent decline in reported cyber “incidents,” to a total of 28,581 incidents. Just three incidents were classified as “major.” But alongside results like that, the government is also warning that the number of attempted cyber-attacks continues to rise, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) warned in April  of a big upswing in pandemic-related attacks by advanced persistent threat (APT) groups. Observed threats included phishing and malware distribution, often targeting newly deployed teleworking infrastructures. “Both CISA and NCSC are seeing a growing use of COVID-19-related themes by malicious cyber actors,” the two agencies said. “At the same time the surge in teleworking has increased the use of potentially vulnerable services, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), amplifying the threat to individuals and organizations.” The rapid turn to telework by Federal civilian agencies to protect workforces and sustain operations during the pandemic has also increased attack surfaces through the addition of more mobile endpoints and home-based connections that are outside the traditional network perimeter. The need to operate outside the existing perimeter ushers zero trust concepts of security into the equation. At the Federal agency level, tech leaders have told MeriTalk in  CIO Crossroads interviews  of major upticks in phishing and other exploits directed against them. Gundeep Ahluwalia, CIO at the Labor Department, illustrated the scope of the problem by saying the agency receives more than six million emails per week, and blocks up to 80 percent of those due to elevated cybersecurity concerns. Cyber Workforce Focus With attack instances on the rise, and attack surfaces in expansion mode, the need to build a more skilled cybersecurity workforce to meet those challenges remains top of mind. That’s not for a lack of effort – the White House and Office of Management Budget have targeted the problem in executive orders and in the President’s Management Agenda, but research published late last year estimated there is a 500,000  worker shortfall  in the U.S., and a bigger number worldwide. While locating enough talented human capital is projected to remain a problem, the answer is likely to lie in using automated technologies like ML and AI to help fill the gap. “Despite the growing cyber workforce, there are still finite resources to meet demand,” said Dr. Matt McFadden, Cyber Director at GDIT. “We need our cyber defenders to maximize their time to focus on the high priority impacts, rather than on the trivial ones they’re bogged down with. Autonomous cyber defense can help solve those challenges – resulting in enhanced perimeter protection, improved endpoint and continuous monitoring, automated patch management, and enriched cyber situational awareness,” he said. Federal Agencies Pressing Ahead Focusing on more than just cybersecurity, numerous Federal agencies are pressing ahead with ML/AI development efforts, better preparing them to implement the fundamental technologies needed for cyber automation. Among those, the Defense Department’s Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC) and the General Services Administration (GSA) said in March  that their Center of Excellence on AI achieved new milestones in leveraging data as a strategic asset, including data management across several mission areas, as well as cybersecurity. In addition, the Defense Department’s groundbreaking effort to enforce tougher cybersecurity standards in the defense industrial base through its Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) program  requires  automated analysis of audit logs to identify and act on critical cybersecurity indicators or other defined suspicious activities. Depending on the outcome of the CMMC effort, it’s a good bet that other Federal agencies with critical infrastructure protection in their portfolios will adopt similar models and requirements. “I see a lot of great outcomes from the shift to autonomous cybersecurity, as a lot of cyber defenses are leveraged in parallel with the zero-trust strategy,” GDIT’s Dr. McFadden said. “One example is the Department of Defense’s CMMC, which demonstrates that the more you leverage automation, the more mature your cybersecurity is.” Legislative Efforts Meanwhile in Congress, new efforts are stirring to devote large Federal investments to data automation technologies that fall in line with the push for automated cybersecurity. Late last month, lawmakers in the House and Senate introduced the bipartisan  Endless Frontier Act  that would overhaul the National Science Foundation (NSF) to jumpstart new research efforts to position the U.S. as a global technology leader. The bill would create a new Technology Directorate at NSF and provide $100 billion of funding over five years for research in a range of fields including ML and AI, cybersecurity, data storage, and data management technologies.

Simple to use, it follows the same process data scientists would use on their own – access and prepare data, train and evaluate models using a variety of machine learning algorithms, and then deploy them. It includes both open source, and AWS-optimized algorithms to do classifications, generate forecasts or recommended actions, as well as perform image recognition, machine translation and text analytics. These are the building blocks with which viable solutions can be rapidly developed. Because every use case is unique, machine learning solutions can’t typically be repurposed to other problem sets. What tools like SageMaker provide is an underlying framework – the storage options, the machine learning algorithms and other components that go into building a viable solution. And by making viable solutions more accessible – and affordable – they promise to speed up the pace of innovation in machine learning throughout the federal marketplace.

When the GDIT Contracts & Acquisition Management Organization (CAMO) team needed contract labor to assist with contract closeouts, data cleansing and contract novation, CAMO Vice President Darryl Scott knew just where to turn. Darryl had worked alongside contract employees from the  National Industries for the Blind  (NIB) since the early 1990s and he was eager to do so again. The NIB is the nation’s largest employment resource for people who are blind. In its more than 80 years in existence, it has created employment opportunities for the visually impaired in nearly every sector of the American economy. NIB and its network of associated agencies employ nearly 6,000 blind men and women, including military veterans, across more than 250 locations nationwide. Together, NIB and its partners produce thousands of products and deliver a variety of professional services for the federal government and U.S. military every year. It’s no surprise that they’re on GDIT’s subcontractor list, and when Darryl found them there, he quickly worked to bring NIB team members onto his project. “Partnering with NIB is a classic case of doing well by doing good,” he said. And that may be an understatement. NIB team members, including those from its partner,  VisionCorps , quickly got to work on the CAMO project. In a few short weeks they’d closed more than 1,500 contracts, undertaken a data cleansing effort impacting more than 1,300 active contracts in our Salesforce database, and are supporting CAMO’s efforts to novate more than 1,300 active contracts and more than 200 inactive ones. They team has been so effective that they’ve been asked to continue to provide the contract labor for these projects through the end of 2020. CAMO’s Senior Director, Janetta Brewer, is beyond thrilled with the team’s performance. She says, “The NIB/VisionCorps team has been the epitome of resilience since the start of the contract. The COVID-19 pandemic prevented the work from being performed onsite as originally intended so we had to transition to a remote work setup. The team demonstrated a great deal of patience as we worked to ship IT equipment to them, grant the appropriate network/systems access, meet their assistive technology needs and provide them with online training. They work well with our CAMO team members and have provided work of the highest quality.” “…innovations can only happen when we come together.

This project between CAMO and NIB is just one way we’re doing that. For their part, the NIB contractors are happy to take on this new challenge. One of them, Dominic Zappone, said, “It’s exciting to work with new people and talk to them on a daily basis. We’re learning every day how to work within their systems too. GDIT personnel have been super helpful. Any questions or concerns we’ve had, they have jumped right on it and helped us right away. The team has been extra accommodating and have gone out of their way to make sure we are all on the right track.” Contractor Tanee Wall was pleased to learn more about contracts in general and the opportunity to use what she’s learned on this project in other endeavors saying, “The GDIT initiative has broadened our contracting knowledge.” Janellen Anskis, a contractor with VisionCorps summed up the spirit of this GDIT/NIB partnership, saying, “I’m honored and excited to be part of the GDIT team. I welcome the opportunity and embrace the challenge of this innovative process. The patience and understanding of the GDIT staff have made this a such a positive experience. As an employee who is blind, this partnership with GDIT is an endeavor that will take VisionCorps and my professional growth to new heights.” We’re grateful for the support and partnership of all of our suppliers, and also for AbilityOne, a program that uses the purchasing power of the Federal government to buy products and services from participating nonprofit agencies that train and employ workers with disabilities, including NIB.

He noticed how the young people in the room read and reflected on those quotes and how important it is to encourage diverse employees and to show them what success looks like. Gianni, building on the reference to HBCUs, talked about the company’s intentional focus on recruiting diverse talent and visiting colleges alongside companies like Microsoft and Amazon and competing for student talent. To be competitive, he said, employers have to showcase the career potential within their organizations as well as their solid D&I commitments, and GDIT is on great footing in both regards.

This meant training missions at Fort Hood, near Killeen, Texas, a U.S. Army base to this day on the periphery of my activities as GDIT employs workers there. Deploying to the north range was like going on an elaborate camping trip or expedition. During the Fort Hood missions, I bonded with the other airmen in my unit – many of whom I keep in touch with to this day. We are honored and grateful to have served and honor others for their sacrificial service keeping our country a free nation. John Light – U.S. Army John Light – U.S. Army I joined in U.S. Army in 1986, where I served in the United States Army Honor Guard as well as the 29th Infantry Division.  I served as both an enlisted soldier as well as an Officer and the Army helped make me who I am today. There is not a day that goes by when I do not reflect on my time in the Army and the lessons they taught me. Whether it was the attention to detail that I learned while a member of The Old Guard, or how to deal with stress and unexpected happenings as found out in Airborne and Air Assault, the Army honed the values I learned as a child and while at the Citadel. It was a true privilege to have served my country, and an honor to have been one of the few chosen as a member of the U.S. Army Honor Guard. Thomas Boyles – U.S. Navy Thomas Boyles – U.S. Navy I spent almost 24 years in the Navy before retiring as a Chief Petty Officer. A majority of my time was spent as an Aviation Warfare Systems Operator (Naval Aircrewman) and Helicopter Rescue Swimmer. I deployed onboard the aircraft carriers U.S.S Enterprise and U.S.S Kitty Hawk several times along with an occasional [helicopter] detachment to other smaller ships. Nothing was more gratifying than being called to provide assistance to those in distress at sea. It was the best job in the Navy. Amelia Snyder – U.S. Air Force Amelia Snyder – U.S. Air Force In 1995, I joined the Air Force right after graduating high school in Charleston, SC. Over the course of almost 22 years, I had the pleasure of being stationed in New Mexico, Germany, Delaware, Mississippi, the United Kingdom, Florida, and Virginia.  I also deployed to Italy, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Sicily, Kyrgyzstan and Afghanistan. Serving my country allowed me to learn the value of diversity and working together.  I have met many people from many walks of life, which put a different perspective on the way I view the world and impacted how I interact with others. I wouldn't trade my time in the service and the places I have traveled for anything. I am especially honored that my son has decided to follow in my footsteps and has also joined the Air Force.  He is currently in Mississippi for training to learn his job – which is the same job I had while I was in the Air Force. Once he graduates, he is heading to Ramstein AB in Germany - where he was born. Michael Bye – U.S. Army Michael Bye – U.S. Army I joined the U.S. Army in November 1977 after graduating from the University of Louisville with a BS degree in Criminal Justice. Upon enlisting, I attended Military Police (MP) basic training and advanced individual training at Fort McClellan in Alabama. In my 22 year career, I was assigned to the 21st Military Police Company (Fort Bragg, NC), the 165th Military Police Company (Fischbach Army Depot, Germany), the 591st Military Police Company (Fort Bliss, TX), the U.S. Army Recruiting Command, and the 8th Military Police Company (Baumholder, Germany). I then served in the Military District of Washington Military Police Company as a SWAT Team leader, working in direct support of the U.S. Secret Service. That was followed by assignments to the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Schofield Barracks (Hawaii) and Fort McClellan before retiring as a First Sergeant. Dennis Disbrow – U.S. Navy Dennis Disbrow – U.S. Navy After graduating from high school, I had no idea of what I wanted to do in life.  I joined the Navy and became a Hospital Corpsman. At the age of 19, I was sent to Vietnam to become a member of the 1st Marine Division, where I treated the sick and wounded Marines, as well as wounded enemy combatants and civilians. Through all of this, I learned that I could make a difference in people’s lives - actually savings lives in some cases. I learned to give, expecting nothing in return. To serve as my duty and to help those who need it most.  To endure hardships and pain to help others in need. To learn and to teach when I had the opportunity. I have tried to carry these lessons into my life and civilian career. Jim Coffey – U.S. Army Jim Coffey – U.S. Army I had the privilege of serving as a soldier and musician in the United States Army Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps from 1979-2006 – which was a unique assignment. The United States Army Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps is one of the Army’s premier musical organizations, and is the only unit of its kind in the Armed Forces.  Our mission was to support the U.S. Army Military District of Washington. In addition to performing in hundreds of ceremonies and parades at Ft. Myer, the Pentagon and various other venues across the Washington, DC area, I also participated in seven presidential inaugurations. I also participated in countless Armed Forces Full Honor Arrival ceremonies at the White House for foreign heads of state, including Queen Elizabeth, Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat. As an official representative of the United States Army I performed at Super Bowl XVI, and marched in the Indianapolis 500, Kentucky Derby and Rose Bowl parades.  I marched in local parades, in local communities and at schools across America in support of the Unites States Army Recruiting Command. As a good will ambassador, I performed in Canada, Germany and France.  After the Gulf War, we toured Germany and France performing for locals and troops who returned to their European duty stations following the war. Kevin Parnacher – U.S. Marines Kevin Parnacher – U.S. Marines I served in the U.S. Armed Forces for 15 years before being medically retired for injuries I received while in service. I was in the U.S. Marine Corps for 5 years assigned to , out of 29 Palms, California. I was an Infantry Assaultman and my job was to be an anti-tank warfare/demolitions expert. I did two combat tours in Iraq between March 2003 and March 2005. After I left the Marines, I joined up with my local National Guard unit in New Mexico. I was assigned to Charlie Co. 1/200th INF for 10 years as an Infantry Squad Leader. And during my time with the Army, I was on the Border Mission in support of the U.S. Border Patrol, participated in the Balikatan Exercises in the Philippines, conducted humanitarian and relief efforts during Hurricane Gustav, and deployed to Kosovo in support of NATO KFOR 14. All while attending college full time! I was fortunate enough to use my G.I. Bill that was provided to me and I took advantage of the opportunity. My experiences have taken me all over the world doing a variety of missions and being a part of history and I would not trade them for anything. I got to meet new people and see places most people aren't aware of its existence in the world. If I had not decided to be more than what I was when I chose to enlist, I would not be where I am today. The military has had a positive effect on my life and although it was tough on my family, the sacrifice that comes with the job was worth it. I apply the 'never quit' attitude that was instilled in me in the military to all aspects in my life and it reflects in my work ethic as a result. However, the experiences I will Honor the most, are those of my brothers in arms who I had the privilege to serve with who came from all over our great nation. And to remember my three brothers who were casualties of war; Lt. Ronald Winchester, LCpl Aaron Simmons, and Cpl Kyle Klunder. They remind me that I must earn my place in life no matter where I am or chose to go and that I should be grateful and blessed. You Honor me for reading this and it has been a pleasure to serve this great land! Honor, Courage, and Commitment. Semper Fi!

Lessons from today’s largest AWS ecosystems reveal the core elements of advanced cloud brokerage from orchestrated governance to layered security. GDIT brings the real-world experience, operating more than 30 cloud brokerage programs on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and managing more than 50,000 cloud instances across a wide variety of government agencies. What lessons can organizations of every size take from one of the largest AWS implementations to use within their own environments? When a customer asks for our first-hand view of working with the government to provide AWS at scale, we often begin with our four key tenets of cloud brokerage: Governance, Brokerage, Automation and Security. Enterprises that address these critical areas position themselves to realize the cost savings, agility and other benefits the AWS cloud can offer. Whether you’re focusing on the business side (e.g., cost control) or on the technical side (e.g., identity and access management), you can use these ideas to create a seamless cloud strategy that works for the enterprise as a whole, no matter the scope and make-up of your cloud infrastructure. The goal is to make things as simple as possible for your users while reducing risks and ensuring the right security to prevent data leakage. Governance Governance When it comes to the first tenet, Governance, it’s important to ensure compliance that includes the implementation of policy- based enforcement and control of cloud resources, providing set workflows and checkpoints for service orders. Another essential is a cloud cost optimization tool for invoicing and billing, cost allocation, right sizing and best practices to help maximize the business value of cloud and efficiently allocate resources. That’s not always easy when you have thousands of discrete AWS billing statements and need to untangle orders and internal chargebacks. With so many statements, the use of a standardized tagging taxonomy simplifies the task. Additionally, incorporating transparency into your service level agreements (SLAs) across multi-clouds is critical, providing one unified view, potentially by integrating your legacy SLA tools with new cloud assets. Brokerage Brokerage In terms of Brokerage, we again want to keep things simple for the customer. We do that by implementing provisioning services to manage resources across multiple environments and keep track of user actions.

Additionally, incorporating transparency into your service level agreements (SLAs) across multi-clouds is critical, providing one unified view, potentially by integrating your legacy SLA tools with new cloud assets. Brokerage Brokerage In terms of Brokerage, we again want to keep things simple for the customer. We do that by implementing provisioning services to manage resources across multiple environments and keep track of user actions. Cloud services are managed through an intuitive service catalog that’s easy to navigate and expand. Dashboards provide visibility into the entire cloud ecosystem, with ad hoc options and consistent reporting across agency, department and application owner. Complementing those elements is self- service. A simplified portal that integrates with your ticketing system can empower users to place orders and resolve issues themselves rather than increasing help desk workloads or creating “rogue” AWS accounts. Automation Automation Users may sometimes make manual interventions that introduce errors. This can be addressed by infusing Automation — the third of our four key tenets — into your cloud strategy. With automation, you can maintain configuration control access across multicloud environments and ensure compliance with security and software updates. You can integrate with existing enterprise investments and better manage capacity and resources by automating the tracking and management of cloud provisioning. That should include the use of resource tagging to track consumption across multicloud environments. Security Security Our fourth tenet is Security, which presents unique challenges in the cloud but is essential to national security. As emerging threats increase in an evolving cloud technology landscape, enterprises must shift the focus from protection to prevention. Prevention, in turn, needs to center on adaptive cyber defense and the deployment of artificial intelligence, machine learning and automation for detection of threats at the edge. Many agencies currently have too many cyber tools and aren’t able to apply them uniformly and lack integration of standards. Common frameworks are contending with increased complexity in hybrid cloud environments and need to free up cyber resources to focus more on research and automation upgrades. Ultimately, enterprises need sound identity and access management with multifactor authentication and a Cloud Access Security Broker to enable centralized security monitoring and management across all cloud resources. The best approach is to integrate cloud native tools with legacy cyber assets in order to maximize the value of your existing investments. The GDIT Cyber Stack offers a path to layered cyber defense in the cloud that creates protection from state-sponsored and terrorist threats, spearfishing and malware, insider attacks and more. Through the GDIT Cyber Stack, we give agencies a comprehensive modular ecosystem of cybersecurity capabilities that map to the Secure Cloud Computing Architecture. We designed and built this suite of solutions in the AWS GovCloud region and integrate it with AWS native security services. Enterprises can select the GDIT Cyber Stack as a physical or virtual platform, on-premise or in the cloud. Orchestration, automation, and a governance model provide for efficient, integrated operation of all GDIT Cyber Stack components. Adversaries thrive in complexity. That’s why it’s increasingly important for the government enterprise to take the simplest possible cloud approach that covers the four key tenets of governance, brokerage, automation and security. This is a lesson that applies not just to the very largest implementations, with their tens of thousands of instances, but to all of the varied AWS cloud journeys agencies are taking today in pursuit of greater agility and performance at lower cost.

Reflections from Women + Technology: EmpowHER," GDIT held the Women + Technology: Empowher conference on October 8 at the Fairview Park Marriott. The event was sponsored by major tech players Dell, Hewlett Packard, Microsoft, Splunk and attended by women IT professionals from all over the DC Metro area. The day was dedicated to the empowerment of women at all levels of their IT careers by providing actionable tools, knowledge and networking skills. Melinda Garvey, founder of AW Media, said the fastest way for women to succeed is to find and build a tribe. Kelli Furrer, VP, Channel and Alliances, Dell, was discouraged by being told she didn't want to work that hard by her boss. Kari VanderVeen, VP and CIO, HPE Financial Services, said she has had to tell herself over and over again, over the course of ten years, that it will be uncomfortable moving into new situations, but just do it anyway.","Driving Innovation with Diverse Perspectives 4 MIN READ MPE,  DEFENSE,  ICAM,  ZERO TRUST ICAM/Zero Trust: At the Core of Interoperability in Mission Partner Environments 51 MIN WATCH CLOUD,  CYBER,  DEFENSE,  DEE Enabling JADC2:Panel featuring: Twinkle Malhotra, Technology Consultant, GDIT Kathlean O'Connor, Director, GDIT Jennifer Fisher, Senior Lead Technical Curriculum Developer Amazon Web Services; Pamela McComas, Program Manager, GDIT Melina Scotto, Federal Health CISO, GDIT Jill Lawson, Partner + VP of Solution Delivery, Itero Group (Moderator) Hot Technologies and Trends *Gain insight into new and emerging technologies that panel members or their respective entities have brought to the market.TAGS TAGS WOMEN + TECHNOLOGY ,  OUR CULTURE  Related EVENT WOMEN + TECHNOLOGY,  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,  CYBER,  OUR CULTURE Women + Technology: LATEST LATEST Reflections from Women + Technology: EmpowHER By  Carly Glenn Carly Glenn Content Strategist October 18th, 2019 GDIT held the Women + Technology: EmpowHER conference on October 8 at the Fairview Park Marriott.Panel featuring: Rachelle Putnam, Director, Information Technology, General Dynamics Land Systems Kari VanderVeen, VP & Chief Information Officer, HPE Financial Services Freddi Donner, Team Engagement Specialist, Business Stamina (Moderator) Kelli Furrer, Vice President, Channel and Alliances, Dell Felicity Coe, Supervisor, Information Technology, General Dynamics Mission Systems Brittany Ninman, General Dynamics Electric Boat (GDEB)Kristie Grinnell Kristie Grinnell , GDIT’s Vice President, Global CIO & Chief Supply Chain Officer, discuss how the answer lies in creating an ecosystem where women are supporting women – all the time, no matter what and if we, as women, invest in each other’s success we will all rise together.","woman, technology, career, tribe, success, certification, day, empowher, vp, panel","global cio, resilient leadership, vice president, kelli furrer, continuous learning, twinkle malhotra, public sector, melina scotto, federal health ciso, kristie grinnell kristie grinnell","WOMEN + TECHNOLOGY ,  OUR CULTURE","LATEST LATEST Reflections from Women + Technology: EmpowHER By  Carly Glenn Carly Glenn Content Strategist October 18th, 2019 GDIT held the Women + Technology: EmpowHER conference on October 8 at the Fairview Park Marriott. The event was sponsored by major tech players Dell, Hewlett Packard, Microsoft, Splunk and attended by women IT professionals from all over the DC Metro area. The day was dedicated to the empowerment of women at all levels of their IT careers by providing actionable tools, knowledge and networking skills. Kristie Grinnell, GDIT’s VP of IT and Supply Chain and Global CIO shared in her opening remarks that only 29% of the IT workforce is currently filled by women when women make up 50% of the total workforce – that needs to change. She said the purpose of EmpowHER is to demonstrate IT is a great field for women to pursue and to spotlight some of the women already there. “We make sure to show the increase in representation of women in this field, so girls growing up are seeing themselves in these new roles that are being created each and every day in areas like artificial intelligence, robotics processing automation....” Attendees heard from accomplished women in IT, many of whom never thought they would end up there. No woman’s path was the same, but their stories had many overlapping lessons. The event was more than an afternoon of speaker sessions. It was a set of powerful themes for us to take back to our work and personal lives. Tribe The first theme and maybe the most popular throughout the day other than IT was  tribe . Melinda Garvey, founder of AW Media and the keynote speaker, said the fastest way for women to succeed is to find and build a tribe. A tribe is a close group of friends and colleagues who advise each other on career moves and challenges each are facing in their professional and personal lives. When asked by the audience what her number one tip is for handling self-doubt, Melinda said she turns to her  tribe . “There is nothing better than having people who will encourage you and will pick you up off the floor, because this is really hard, and it’s always hard. You get a lot of no’s whenever you’re starting anything…my tribe is critically important.” The act of building a tribe was proactively encouraged as attendees were challenged to connect with five new people via LinkedIn throughout the course of the event."," LATEST LATEST Reflections from Women + Technology: EmpowHER By  Carly Glenn Carly Glenn Content Strategist October 18th, 2019 GDIT held the Women + Technology: EmpowHER conference on October 8 at the Fairview Park Marriott.

You get a lot of no’s whenever you’re starting anything…my tribe is critically important.” The act of building a tribe was proactively encouraged as attendees were challenged to connect with five new people via LinkedIn throughout the course of the event. Resiliency We heard about “resiliency” or “the ability to snap back, to get up and go again…and show up the next day” from all of the day’s speakers. However, in the “Stories of Resilient Leadership and Career Success” session, each panelist shared a specific time when she had to tell herself to keep going. Kelli Furrer, VP, Channel and Alliances, Dell recalled when she had asked for a promotion and was discouraged by being told she didn’t want to work that hard by her boss. Following this encounter and knowing it was her decision to determine how hard she wanted to work, she decided to pivot and keep moving forward. Kari VanderVeen, VP and CIO, HPE Financial Services, said she has had to tell herself over and over again, over the course of ten years, that it will be uncomfortable moving into new situations, “but just do it anyway.” She closed the session with strong words encouraging resiliency: “Step out there. Stay curious. Know that a failure isn’t a permanent setback…it’s a learning opportunity.” Technology Certifications and Continuous Learning In a time where technology is changing each and every day, it is important for IT professionals (and even non-IT professionals) to be continuous learners. Speakers from the Certifications for Success panel shared several examples where certifications helped shape their career and set them up for advancement. Luckily there are several free, online certification offerings. Twinkle Malhotra, Alliances Manager, GDIT spoke to Salesforce’s online courses based on career interests and Christine Halvorsen, Public Sector, National Security Team, AWS, advised keeping an eye out for AI/ML training offerings being made available in the near future. Certifications can also bring financial gains, but Melina Scotto, Federal Health CISO, GDIT noted that aside from the monetary benefits, there is nothing like the feeling of accomplishment and self-confidence when one receives their first certification. Delivery During her fireside chat session, Amy Gilliland, President of GDIT, stressed the importance of delivery and doing things well. “There is nothing that speaks louder than execution. When we perform, that is a testimony to what we can do.” Melinda also spoke to this saying “You can’t sit back and feel bad about something, complain about something and not build those networks…you’re here! What are you going to do with it, because we can’t wait for others…” You have to make your opportunity and then follow through with the delivery. Focusing on what we do, and doing it well will set us up for success. Final Thoughts Events like Women + Technology: EmpowHER is where the work of growing the next generation of female leaders begins to flourish. If young girls can see women in c-suite and technology roles, they’ll believe they can do it, too, and GDIT takes this seriously. After winning the EmpowHER cyber hackathon, Nadia Osman, a college student from George Mason University, was offered a full-time job with GDIT once she graduates in May 2020. Excited and inspired, I’m eager to take these powerful lessons of tribe, resiliency, continuous learning and delivery forward into my career. I’ll share them with my own tribe and encourage other women to pursue careers in IT. It’s up to all of us to lift women up, align ourselves with allies and close the representation gap in the IT workforce.

Speakers encouraged attendees to keep an open mind when approaching IT careers, since not all positions involve coding and software development. They encouraged attendees to explore the opportunities that lie outside of coding – such as project management or marketing IT solutions and products – should they be uninterested in doing such jobs as software development. When it came to advancing within the IT field, one of the common themes across many of the panel discussions and presentations was a need to dream big, be confident in one’s abilities and to stand up and ask for opportunities. This need to dream big and have high aspirations was reinforced by Deborah James, who pleaded with attendees, “For heaven's sake, have those big aspirations. Don't be afraid to dream big about what you can achieve and what you wish to do.” James shared that men, “…tend to be better than [women] are at having those big aspirations,” and encouraged women to, “Be aware of this and push yourself to dream big.” As many of the speakers noted, when it comes to seeking advancement and opportunity, many women allow self-doubt and self- confidence to stand in the way. This was reflected in a story shared by Teresa Carlson, who noted that within AWS, “…when a job description…goes up, women will say, ‘I don't meet all of the criteria for going and taking that job,’ while a man will say, ‘I can do that,’ and apply even though they don't have all of the skills.” Carlson encouraged attendees to overcome that self-doubt and aspire to more, noting that, “[Women] have such an opportunity in the US. We are so blessed...you can do anything in this country. Be bold. Have grit. You can do it. You have amazing talent. When you get a seat at the table have a seat at the table. Ask for the things that you want.” Attendees at the Women + Technology Summit listen as Teresa Carlson, Vice President of Worldwide Public Sector at Amazon Web Services, discusses the career path that took her to the top of the world's leading cloud provider. And Carlson wasn’t alone in sharing stories about how self-doubt, or how being the only women at the table, can intimidate female professionals and keep them from taking leadership roles. Janice Haith, VP of Federal Government Business Development at Oracle discussed a time when she was civilian employee within the Department of Defense (DoD), when a group of women leaders came together and shared stories about, “…how all of us had sat at the table and just said nothing and just let the guys run over us, even though we knew in the back of [our] mind that this was not the right thing to do or that it's not going to work.” Haith encouraged the young women in the room to, “…sit at the table. And if you sit at the table, you need to say something.” Another theme that resonated across the presentations and panel discussions was the need to identify and rely on mentors and sponsors, as well as a need to network and build professional associations. This was encouraged by almost every speaker, including Rachelle Putnam, the Director for Information Technology at General Dynamics Land Systems, who challenged attendees to, “Find mentors. I've found mentorship to be the most valuable thing throughout my entire career. “ However, much like professional advancement, the speakers highlighted how mentorship and sponsorship was something that professional women need to pursue and feel comfortable asking for. Kristie Grinnell confirmed this when she said, “It is okay to ask someone to be your sponsor. If you are trying to get somewhere and you know that's going to help you, ask someone to be your sponsor.” But sponsorship and mentorship isn’t enough; building a professional network is just as important. As Deborah James explained, “Mentors and networks can contribute big time to your success. Mentors can help you build your roadmap, but your network will help you navigate that roadmap.” Overall, the 2018 Women + Technology Summit was a huge success that helped provide practical strategies to women looking to enter the IT field or advance their careers.  The success stories of this group of women who have made it to the top of their respective field provided inspiration for the next generation of CIOs, CISOs and other IT leaders. With role models and mentors like the speakers at this year’s Summit, it’s fair to assume that it won’t be long until the percentage of female CIOs in the Fortune 500 more accurately represents society as a whole.

His enlightening Q&A follows below. MeriTalk: MeriTalk:  With so many people teleworking now, organizations have a broader attack surface due to increased use of mobility and cloud solutions. What are some of the top challenges agencies face in this environment? Dr. McFadden: Dr. McFadden:  The main challenge with the increase in telework is that most agencies’ infrastructure wasn’t designed to meet the demand of an almost 100 percent remote user workforce. For some of our customers, we’ve had to work hard to scale their architecture, which could be anything from leveraging the cloud to supplementing the network devices that they have. For example, we had an agency customer that couldn’t provide remote access to their workers and gave us five days to implement a virtual private network (VPN) portal to support thousands of mobile users who couldn’t work from home without it – which we successfully completed. MeriTalk: MeriTalk:  Now that we are a few months into the COVID-19 pandemic, are you still seeing agencies having issues with supporting telework or is it mostly resolved? Dr. McFadden: Dr. McFadden:  I definitely think things have smoothed out a bit since COVID-19 first began affecting the workforce. Agencies are now working on more long-term strategies around the mobile workforce, and how they can scale and provide capabilities to support it over time, even when we all go back to the office. MeriTalk: MeriTalk:  Are there any other challenges that you are seeing, aside from scalability? Dr. McFadden: Dr. McFadden:  There is always the threat aspect you need to look out for in remote environments. Most agency cyber defenders are focused on those big existing perimeters that they’re used to supporting. As they go deeper into this mobile realm, they’re"," LATEST LATEST Autonomous Cyber: What It Is, What It Delivers, and Why You Need It By  Dr. Matthew McFadden Dr. Matthew McFadden Vice President, Cyber & Distinguished Technologist September 10th, 2020 The options available to agencies to protect and secure their crucial data are greater in number than ever before. Responding to cyber threats or vulnerabilities in real-time is no longer the aspiration, thanks to artificial intelligence and machine learning. But how do agencies use these advances to their advantage, how can they make their cyber initiatives as effective as possible, and what should they know before they begin? For many, Autonomous Cyber is the answer. GDIT’s Cyber Director, Dr. Matt McFadden, recently spoke with Meritalk about Autonomous Cyber, why it’s more important than ever and how the COVID-19 pandemic (and the massive shift to remote working) is affecting agencies’ need to secure their informational assets across multiple platforms and devices.

MeriTalk: MeriTalk:  Are there any other challenges that you are seeing, aside from scalability? Dr. McFadden: Dr. McFadden:  There is always the threat aspect you need to look out for in remote environments. Most agency cyber defenders are focused on those big existing perimeters that they’re used to supporting. As they go deeper into this mobile realm, they’re starting to see the increased use of endpoint devices or different remote work scenarios impacting their environments. They will have to adapt their operations to support that and increase emphasis on using a zero-trust approach because of it. MeriTalk: MeriTalk:  How do you define autonomous cybersecurity, and how can this model better protect agencies’ crucial data? Dr. McFadden: Dr. McFadden:  Autonomous cybersecurity is the automation of your cyber defense capabilities and the ability to adapt and respond in real time. Cyber threats are constantly changing, increasing, and growing more sophisticated. And, as more agencies move to the cloud, there is more data to analyze than ever before, especially at the edge. Despite the growing cyber workforce, there are still finite resources to meet demand. We need our cyber defenders to maximize their time to focus on the high priority impacts, rather than on the trivial ones they’re bogged down with. Autonomous cyber defense can help solve those challenges – resulting in enhanced perimeter protection, improved endpoint and continuous monitoring, automated patch management, and enriched cyber situational awareness. MeriTalk: MeriTalk:  Responding to threats in real-time can make all the difference in an agency’s exposure to a cyber-adversary. How can agencies integrate automation tools like AI/ML to detect zero-day and other unknown threats, and reduce response time? Dr. McFadden: Dr. McFadden:  The main point here is that artificial intelligence and machine learning are not the end-all, be-all for cyber practices – it’s more about how you apply them. AI/ML can help detect unknown threats, as well as provide a way to respond by blocking uncharacteristic traffic. They can help agencies orchestrate a response that allows for vulnerability prioritization and reconfiguration of systems in real time. For example, where you more traditionally relied on signatures, using a signature-less detection capability can help detect those unknown threats. The more traditional methods don’t necessarily go away, but AI/ML are used to supplement the ability to detect those zero-day type threats. This aligns with autonomous cyber defense, where sometimes agencies will reference AI/ML, but are actually more focused on the automation component. GDIT is essentially trying to drive detection to respond in near real time, so if we find a cyber threat, we can automatically remediate it. This could include reconfiguring a misconfiguration issue or patching a known vulnerability. There are many different application areas, and GDIT is looking to work with agencies to define concrete use cases that will help improve their cyber outcomes. MeriTalk: MeriTalk:  Can you provide any examples? Dr. McFadden: Dr. McFadden:  One of the large enterprise agencies we work with leverages GDIT’s Cyber Stack to reduce the workload of analytical response by 85 percent. We looked at the top use cases and cyber events that bogged their security operations center (SOC) response capabilities down to identify areas where we could use autonomous cyber defense. Leveraging GDIT’s Security, Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) tool in the Cyber Stack, we orchestrated and automated the response actions to alleviate the tier one and tier two responders from having to manually respond to incidents. This 85 percent reduction in manual response time allowed the team to focus more of their resources on more impactful cyber events. MeriTalk: MeriTalk:  Can you describe an example of a cyber event that could bog down an agency’s security operations center (SOC)? Dr. McFadden: Dr. McFadden:  Phishing emails are a great example and are a common threat in the workforce. Every time an employee receives a phishing email, it is detected and reported, requiring SOC analysts to investigate if the attack was a targeted threat. Rather than manually going through and finding the cyber event and analyzing the intent and origin, we can automate that piece of the response to look at certain indicators to see where it came from, including the IP address, if it was a targeted spear phishing email to a top executive, etc. By automating the response, we can more efficiently receive and assess the data to prevent a future attack and reduce the manual processes needed. MeriTalk: MeriTalk:  What is GDIT doing to drive automation in its cyber capabilities so organizations can increase efficiencies in their operations? Dr. McFadden: Dr. McFadden:  We created the GDIT Cyber Stack to build a multi-cloud cyber defense capability that focuses on the integration and automation of cyber capabilities, using more cloud-native cybersecurity products from all of the major cloud service providers (CSPs). We wanted to increase efficiency by building a cloud platform where multiple agencies and mission partners can work together, rather than building a cyber capability set for each implementation. By leveraging more cloud-native tools, we can increase integration and perform better cueing and orchestration of defenses and remediation, improve vulnerability identification and autonomous patching, and use adaptive defense and self-securing systems. MeriTalk: MeriTalk:  How do you see autonomous cyber defense re-shaping Federal cybersecurity strategies in the future? Dr. McFadden: Dr. McFadden:  I see a lot of great outcomes from the shift to autonomous cybersecurity, as a lot of cyber defenses are leveraged in parallel with the zero-trust strategy. One example is the Department of Defense’s Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC), which demonstrates that the more you leverage automation, the more mature your cybersecurity is. MeriTalk: MeriTalk:  SOAR plays a vital role in implementing an autonomous cyber defense strategy. Talk us through the steps of SOAR and the importance of using this model in government systems. Dr. McFadden: Dr. McFadden:  As part of our Cyber Stack capabilities, we defined a functional set of cyber requirements that aligns to the DoD’s Secure Cloud Computing Architecture (SCCA) and TIC 3.0 requirements. Using those requirements, we develop playbooks and use cases to automate components. We typically work with agencies to determine the top incidents and most resource-intensive incidents where we can use automation to drive efficiencies. We look at how we can detect unknown threats and how we can respond and orchestrate in near real time. A lot of the cases we run into require solutions to automate patching and configuration management. We want to be as proactive as possible to reduce our attack surface, and SOAR is a big part of that. MeriTalk: MeriTalk:  What advice can you give to agencies looking to adopt autonomous cybersecurity practices? What are the biggest obstacles they run into? Dr. McFadden: Dr. McFadden:  Stakeholder buy-in is very important. At any large Federal agency, there are multiple stakeholders with different roles and responsibilities for different areas of the organization. For example, you may have a network team or the CISO team might not be organized under the CIO or the SOC may operate independently. In order to adopt autonomous cyber defense effectively, you have to be able to automate across the entire stack. To do that, the stakeholders need to agree on the prioritization of use cases and the orchestration actions that we’re providing. But most importantly, stakeholders need to understand they won’t move to full autonomous cyber defense on day one; it’s a phased approach of understanding outcomes and measuring metrics over time. In addition to figuring out the people aspect, agencies also need to determine if they have the right technology capabilities to do autonomous cyber defense. Having a clear capability rationalization is very helpful as they’re getting started, as well as knowing how well their existing vendor tools integrate with other cybersecurity vendors’ ecosystems. It’s all about providing a comprehensive integrated approach. MeriTalk: MeriTalk:  One of the biggest challenges the Federal government faces in implementing new technologies is associated cost. How can agencies best work with the private sector and gain buy-in from decision makers? Dr. McFadden: Dr. McFadden:  At GDIT, we have a very large cyber alliance partnership that helps drive down costs across multiple vendors and partners. We have a great deal of insight into the implementation process and can help advise agencies on how to reduce spending on unnecessary products and services, as well as realize capability rationalization. Through the modular capability approach the Cyber Stack offers, we can swap out certain products based on mission or agency’s needs to ensure we meet the capability requirements. MeriTalk: MeriTalk:  Anything else you’d like to cover today? Dr. McFadden: Dr. McFadden:  We built our Cyber Stack solution to help address the emerging threats changing the threat landscape. By leveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning, and automation, we can adapt to those threats and work together with other vendors to improve cybersecurity outcomes. Pairing the top cyber defense platforms with a zero-trust strategy is the perfect formula for a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy. Learn more about  GDIT’s cyber capabilities .

There is an inherent need for protection and access control to ensure only those with appropriate permissions gain access to information. ICAM meets that need. As MPEs evolve and implement fewer manual processes in order to enable faster decision making, the need for interoperability of mission systems is more apparent than ever. ICAM enables that interoperability by ensuring secure access to only those authorized to have it. MPEs and CJADC2 Are Close Analogs; ICAM Enables Both At the end of the day, MPEs and CJADC2 are close analogs. CJADC2 was created to connect the entire Department of Defense ecosystem and MPE is about ensuring we can connect with mission partners in a secure and seamless way across applications, services. and mission-connected capabilities. ICAM is central to both efforts. CJADC2 has created the expectation that information should be sharable – securely– across all environments. Information should be available and accessible and should transit a network as quickly as possible when it’s needed. This mindset is informing how to develop next-generation, data centric MPE that ICAM enables. The intention now is to build persistent, long-standing networks, rather than episodic ones, which can be used for a variety of missions. ICAM can establish linkages between environments and enable the exchange of data to allow mission partners to access information on our networks. Zero Trust Means We Can Treat Partners As Users Additionally, Zero Trust and its constant validation of access means we can enable partner access in the same way as internal users. That is to say, when everyone is untrusted, we can treat everyone the same way. ICAM removes the limitations from our environments and allows users to traverse them while maintaining a high level of security in a much more efficient manner. It streamlines our approach to connecting with mission partners and ensures data is accessible at the speed of relevance. That’s important because, at the end of the day, we’re not only protecting our networks, we’re protecting the data and information assets that live on them. We Must Help Mission Partners Leverage Their IT Combat Power The reality is that we build coalitions to combine capabilities; to create a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. We need to allow and encourage our mission partners to leverage their IT combat power and ICAM and Zero Trust accelerate our ability to do that. These technologies are enabling us to push control to a more granular level and to make it more dynamic at the same time. ICAM gives us the versatility of control to authorize who sees what, when they can see it, and for how long. It gives Commanders the flexibility to control access to networks they own and to make real-time decisions about the operational needs of their environments while remaining secure. A Vision for the Future The vision should be to create a single, persistent, flat environment for users to get what they need. At a time when we prioritize speed and can act faster than ever before – in analytics, in decisioning, in theater – we should be working to remove barriers to how we communicate with partners. We have a tremendous cadre of global mission partners with different rules governing their data and information assets; but we’re still going to need to communicate with them and share information, securely, at machine speeds. A commitment to ICAM and Zero Trust principles enables that. And in that way, it is more than an enhancement to information-sharing, it’s a true warfighting capability.

WATCH NOW |  0," GDIT's Tim Gilday and Mike Wagner sit down to discuss how the U.S. government is using biometrics as part of a mosaic of authentication tools.   WATCH NOW |  0 We have so many subject matter experts at GDIT – people who have spent their entire careers focused on a technology or a capability and who have seen its evolution over time, largely because they’ve been part of it along the way. Recently, I had the pleasure of speaking to Mike Wagner, a vice president at GDIT and a biometrics expert who has spent 16 years working in the field, largely in support of immigration work for clients. Mike talked with me about how the U.S. government is using biometrics as part of a mosaic of authentication tools that allow us to confidently confirm identities. He also talked about the unique security considerations related to biometric data such as fingerprints or iris scans, and its position as “super PII” because it is not only personally identifiable information but information that, unlike your address or even your name, can never change. Here are a few more insights he shared. Biometrics is more than what you see in movies. Biometrics can be used in different ways. We call them different “modalities” referring to things like fingerprints or iris scans. The movies will often talk about retinal scans. That’s incorrect; the retina is in the back of your eye. The iris, the colored part around the pupil, is what’s scanned. The movies also brought us the idea that colored contacts can spoof these scanners; that’s not the case anymore and it is very hard to trick the advanced technologies that are used nowadays. And that’s important, because biometrics are increasingly used as part of a mosaic of user authentication tools. We think about things like your password telling us what you know; a token telling us what you have in your possession to authenticate yourself; and then biometrics telling us who you are. Taken together, all three of those things contribute to security in a meaningful way. GDIT’s lab is customizing solutions for government missions. Biometrics, as part of the mosaic I described above, are a great tool to positively identify a person. They’re used a lot for data sharing and interoperability, and when compared to names, addresses or social security numbers alone, they’re much more sophisticated. That’s why the U.S. government is especially interested in biometrics for things like immigration or law enforcement use cases. In our  Identity and Biometrics Lab at GDIT  we are focused on understanding these use cases and working with customers and technology providers to understand what’s available, what innovations we can bring about together, and how we can tailor solutions to a unique mission need. We’re also prototyping and testing these innovations in an effort to bring them to market, and ultimately meet the mission, faster. Biometrics and zero trust go hand in hand. Biometrics supports a  zero trust approach  to securing data and systems. In environments where identities must be validated at every layer, biometrics can provide an additional way to confirm identities and regulate access as part of a suite of comprehensive and complementary authentication tools. At the same time, biometric data itself is in need of protection and sophisticated security. Integrators need to draw on the strengths of all of the existing authentication technologies and GDIT takes that role very seriously in the work we do, OUR INDUSTRIES OUR INDUSTRIES Learn more about our work in biometrics. HOMELAND SECURITY the integrations we provide, and the support we give the government. The acceleration in biometric use is here to stay. Following the coronavirus pandemic, we saw a lot of acceleration in biometric technology – and for good reason. Contact-less solutions of all forms were in high demand. Technology providers helped facilitate biometric interactions by accelerating the development of contactless capture methods and tools. But along with that come real privacy and security considerations – and they exist on a spectrum. Facial recognition tools on social media can, for example, identify people in photos. But would we all consent to being surveilled in public and having our biometric data passively collected? The acceleration in biometric use is going to require us to confront questions like this. To date, the U.S. government has opted for an opt-in model where we authorize the use of our biometric data for convenience or security purposes – such as faster check-ins at an airport or more secure access to banking applications on our phones. The use of biometric technology is only going to become more ubiquitous and it’s up to us to define how we can securely, without compromising our principles around privacy, interact in this new world. I’m grateful to Mike for the time he spent with me – we could have spent twice as much time together and still only scratched the surface of this exciting topic area. I hope you’ll watch the full video for more of our conversation about this important capability we are leveraging for essential and evolving customer missions.

And, after having spent more than a dozen years doing exactly this for a key customer, I’m glad to take the opportunity to share five data center management best practices that have nothing to do with technology. Why? Because with these best practices at play, you can do more than you ever imagined on the technology side, and have a tremendously positive impact on the strategic management of an agency’s informational assets. Listen. It sounds simple because it is. It’s also easy to do poorly. It’s essential to really listen to your customers and understand the problems they’re looking to solve. Understand the vision as it changes from leader to leader or from director to director. Listen to what your customer is focused on. Understand what they’re intentionally not focused on and why, and understand what they’re not yet focused on, and why. Then, act accordingly. Read the Room. Regardless of the space you’re in, good mission partners know how to read the room. They’re sensitive to culture shifts in the organization and to the external pressures – be they regulatory, environmental or financial – that are top of mind for them. With that knowledge, partners will know best when to propose solutions and how, and how to do so in a way that best guarantees their adoption. Be Flexible. Similarly, good data center partners are flexible. They move at the customer’s pace. They flex and contract as the customer needs them to. They understand that there are multi-dimensional IT needs at place in large, enterprise organizations and they accommodate the customer and the mission no matter what. Build Industry Relationships. And use them. Create trusted and collaborative relationships with industry partners and create a technology ecosystem in service of your customer. Work as a team to advance their mission and goals and bring together the right people with the right expertise who share your sincere commitment to getting the job done. Scout the Space. Use conferences and events as one of several ways to reach new people, make new connections and interact with new technology. As an example, when object storage moved from on-prem S8 into the intelligence community, we were able to quickly develop roadmaps that evolved with the mission need because we were in the know about it early. Data centers can sometimes be viewed as a commodity. As technology changes and evolves, swapping in new technology for the old seems like a transactional exercise. But good data center partners are collaborators with a sincere interest in an agency’s growth and mission delivery. This is the mindset enabled us to help our client achieve more than $38 million in cost savings. We worked with them on a migration plan to S3 cloud storage that avoided additional costs from power, space and cooling. We helped them visualize a more efficient data center and how to do more with less. We listened and understood their information lifecycle and were able to insert a flexible maintenance and procurement plan that worked for them. Technology played a supporting role in that success. It happened because we understood the customer, we understood their challenges and their environment, we were up to speed on the technologies that could help solve problems for them and we were flexible in its implementation. This is what we mean when we say that some of the most important data center best practices actually have nothing to do with technology.

CYBER"," OUR CAPABILITIES OUR CAPABILITIES Learn more about how GDIT helps customers across the federal government with this important endeavor, as well as about our entire portfolio of cybersecurity services. CYBER Security teams have an inherent advantage over attackers. They know their environments better than anyone. They can monitor those environments, control user activity on their networks, plan and perform preparation training – all in an effort to prevent attacks and drive resilience. This gives cybersecurity leaders the “defender’s advantage” – albeit a temporary and fleeting one – over their attackers during a breach. This means that even as the complexity of attacks and sophistication of the attackers evolve, careful and deliberate attention paid to preserving this advantage can serve an organization well. Federal agencies can take five important steps to maintain their defender’s advantage. Incentivize Collaboration Federal agencies are big and comprised of multiple departments and functions. Often, in these environments, security is inadvertently compartmentalized from group to group and can destroy the defender’s advantage.  Leaders should encourage their teams to view cybersecurity as an enterprise function  and should incentivize collaboration across groups to facilitate the sharing of best practices, create a culture of cooperation, and to strengthen the agency’s overall security posture. For example, implement a cross-functional cybersecurity task force with representatives from across IT, HR, legal, and operations teams. This task force can meet regularly to share insights, discuss emerging threats, and collaborate on incident response plans. Know Your Environment and Baseline Assets Yes, your defender’s advantage includes the knowledge of your environment and a baseline understanding of your assets that you have but your attackers don’t.  That’s why it’s important to conduct regular inventory audits to ensure you have an up-to-date understanding of all hardware, software, and data assets on your network . This can help identify unauthorized or unsecured devices and applications. The same goes for your suite of cyber tools across all capability demand areas ranging from cyber hunt, cyber operations, threat intelligence, incident response, monitoring and detection, risk management and more. The defender’s advantage depends on current and reliable information – information that is incumbent upon you to gather and maintain. Engineer and Architect Security Solutions for Your Environment Combined with knowledge of your network and what people do on it, your knowledge of the purpose-built solutions and how they work also contributes to the defender’s advantage. It’s imperative that cyber leaders are aware of the security solutions running on their networks, how they work and how they protect mission critical systems. A gap in this knowledge is a gap attackers will find and exploit. For instance,  fully embrace a zero trust architecture  that aligns with your knowledge of the network, assets, and mission. This approach assumes that no users or device is trusted by default, which complements your defender’s advantage. Implementing zero trust may involve segmenting the network, requiring additional authentication for privileged users, consistently monitoring for unusual activity within the network perimeter, and employing tools that help validate the legitimacy of users and devices. By focusing on zero trust, you ensure a breach in one area doesn’t compromise multiple systems, ultimately strengthening your security posture. Lean Forward With Planning and Preparation When it comes to cybersecurity , knowledge gathering is only as important as your knowledge-sharing. Make sure you are conducting the appropriate planning and preparedness exercises across teams. Ensure processes and procedures are in place and operating as intended. Get your teams ready for inevitable breaches and ability to bounce back. This includes looking at how to use automation effectively as well as appropriately training your people to handle higher value order tasks. You have the advantage, don’t get complacent. Choose Partners With Mission-Centric Approaches In cybersecurity, as in footwear and in fashion, one size does not fit all. Ensure your partners are taking mission-centric approaches to securing your enterprise. Create – execute and then update – customized operational playbooks that support resilience rather than remediation. Attacks will happen. Your focus should be on mission continuity and restoring operations as quickly as possible. Partners often have greater agility and flexibility and can dynamically align services with needs. Make sure you have the right partners on your team. When selecting cybersecurity vendors and partners, prioritize those that have a proven track record of working with organizations similar to yours in size and mission. They should be able to demonstrate their understanding of your unique challenges and tailor their solutions accordingly. Indeed, the defender’s advantage gives agencies a leg up on their cyber attackers. That’s why preserving it is so important and requires constant attention and calibration.

Today, like nearly every other industry around the world,  artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)  are powerful tools that geospatial professionals now have at their disposal. OUR CAPABILITIES OUR CAPABILITIES Learn more about our Artificial Intelligence portfolio. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE In years past, teams relied on relatively simplistic workflows of measuring the impacts of climate change. Remote sensing via multi- spectral satellites could provide images which could examine things like vegetation health, soil composition and water saturation. By looking at these images and analyzing health using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), as one example, teams could assess the health and stress levels of vegetation. The challenges with using images from satellites (at the time) was low temporal resolution, or how often a sensor could image the same spot on the earth’s surface. Some sensors were only providing new images on average every 17 days. Anything catastrophic happening between the satellites passes would be unobserved in near real-time. Fast forward to today and there are more satellites in low-earth orbit (LEO) than ever. Researchers can obtain satellite images from almost anywhere on the planet at any time. Satellite sensors are better too, and they produce better images, with better resolution more often and with more data-dense outputs. This availability of data is precisely why the proliferation of AI/ML technology is so important. These satellites are creating more data than humans could ever process or analyze. AI can help discover patterns and insights and we can capture these through deep learning and computer vision models to identify outliers or changes in the images. AI/ML technologies have already been put to work in a variety of climate change-related applications. For instance, they have been utilized to monitor deforestation and illegal logging activities, detect changes in sea levels and ice sheets, and identify areas at risk of flooding or drought. By combining satellite imagery with AI/ML algorithms, we can track and predict the impacts of climate change on ecosystems and communities, allowing for more informed decision-making and proactive intervention. When the models know what “right” looks like, they can give analysts indications and warnings about areas to monitor more closely, as one example. AI-assisted predictive models can help assess the impacts of climate change and identify ways to mitigate its effects. These tools can also be used to understand and assess the impact of human-caused disasters, like the Ohio train derailment or the Indiana plastics factory explosion – to give two examples from recent weeks alone. These tools can help gauge the travel patterns of air pollutants and predict where they’ll go next as well as what the impact will be to the environment, and ultimately – to humans. Overall, the consumption and analysis of massive amounts of data – enabled by AI/ML – has begun to change how we solve complex, climate-related problems.  AI/ML can inform policy making at the federal, state, and local levels. They can also contribute to the growing body of academic research and understanding of climate change. This information, in turn, impacts how businesses operate and perform resource planning. AI and ML enable us to leverage and employ more advanced, reliable, and automated analytics. And with a challenge as pressing as climate change, this becomes more important than ever. Already, AI and ML are enabling more capabilities in the geospatial space than ever before. Leveraging that potential for the future will depend on ensuring data compatibility across application development and integration. It will depend on compliance with universally recognized data quality standards, like those from the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). We’ll also need to make existing and new AI/ML models more accessible to more users. GDIT is working with customers and agency partners to address these challenges and to further enhance our AI capabilities in the geospatial intelligence community.  We are developing and implementing strategies to make AI/ML a community effort. Fundamentally, we believe that, together,  we can mitigate the impact of climate change and sustain our environment in a more positive manner. And this Earth month, there doesn’t seem to be a more important mission than that.

Mission OUR INDUSTRIES OUR INDUSTRIES Learn more about how GDIT is building the next generation MPE. MPE Partner Environments (MPE) are designed to allow the military and its mission partners to work collaboratively and effectively and to share sensitive, classified information securely. For the last several years of my career in the Army, I led a team at U.S. Central Command whose mission was to envision and develop a next generation MPE. The goal was to consolidate our many mission partner networks into a single, unified environment that allows for all releasable information to be co-located and accessed by mission partners and users at the speed of operations. Rapidly evolving technology and capabilities make this work even more complex and even more important to national defense. Disparate data types and formats at varying levels of releasability, streaming from different sensors and environments, present significant challenges. These challenges exist across the Combatant Commands, our Mission Partners and even the individual defense Services themselves. Essential, Real-Time Information Sharing Today, MPE is getting a lot of focus, not only because national defense strategy directs it, but also because we’ve seen the benefits of partners and coalitions coming together to advance combined national interests and security efforts. While information-sharing during peacetime is important, timely sharing during a conflict can enable so much more because the strengths each partner brings to the fight can be more effectively leveraged. With the advancements in coalition interoperability and information sharing, we can also envision a future where the MPE is the actual warfighting network. As the Services, Combatant Commands and the Department continue to align their vision and efforts, we grow closer to a time where Warfighters can conduct training and pre-deployment coordination with Mission Partners on the same network that they will conduct operations on. The goal is for Warfighters, at home or in theater, US or Coalition, to have access to the right information at the right time at the speed the mission requires. Further Enabling Communication Across Domains The Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) initiative is especially aligned with this vision. Its goal is to empower Joint Force Commanders to effectively command across all warfighting domains through the employment of innovative technologies to enable faster decision-making. As we look at this problem set, the MPE contributions to that goal becomes clear. As the core JADC2 problem is sharing with ourselves across the different warfighting domains, we see that solving MPE challenges inherently solves JADC2 challenges. A similar effort is underway in the Intelligence arena. The U.S. Battlefield Information Collection and Exploitation Systems (BICES) effort is aimed at enabling operations and intelligence information sharing among coalition partners. GDIT is supporting this work and, just as with MPE, learnings from the BICES initiative will enhance and accelerate the JADC2 effort. In January the contract was recently extended by the Air Force Mission Partner Capabilities Office through May 2025. Innovation that Keeps Pace with Technology Evolution At GDIT, our focus is to innovate around interoperability. The DoD employs hundreds of mission command applications and ensuring they can interoperate with each other and with mission partners is critical. We are working on the MPE to understand where those shortfalls are and to effect change, helping to ensure the US, and our partners, can collaboratively counter peer and near-peer adversaries. Without question, the MPE and JADC2 initiatives are vitally important DoD efforts focused on fostering collaboration and communication. GDIT is proud to do our part to support these initiatives via our MPE work and are committed to its continued success.

MPE environments that enable voice communication, electronic information sharing, video conferencing and more. Developed to be both a method of communicating, intelligence-sharing and command and control enablers, MPEs are an essential tool in diplomacy during peacetime and in conflict. GDIT currently operates and sustains the largest MPE for the Department of Defense. Our continual innovation and modernization of MPEs are creating ever-more responsive, resilient, and flexible systems that can be rapidly deployed to respond to real-world events. Some of the systems GDIT operates and sustains can securely connect 30 to 40 defense ministers or intelligence leaders from around the world at a moment’s notice. They have been used as a critical tool for information- and intelligence-sharing throughout the U.S. European Command (USEUCOM) over the last few months. From an IT perspective, MPEs are required to apply strict, multi-level security rules and access controls across classification levels. The MPE’s must also be designed to follow strategic agreements and treaties such as the numerous bilateral and multilateral information- sharing agreements between the U.S. and its allies. Recent policy for secure information sharing has opened up new technological approaches for enabling complex access management and zero trust concepts. This results in more rapid and flexible information exchange and enhanced interoperability with coalition partners. Referred to as data-centric security architectures, these systems provide new opportunities to achieve DoD’s evolving information sharing goals to protect national interests. Put plainly, GDIT operates and sustains the most mature, elaborate, extensive and capable MPE in operation today. Utilizing cross-domain solutions from General Dynamics Mission Systems, GDIT deploys MPE environments quickly and in the context of the mission and the uniqueness of the requirements of modern-day MPEs. Around the world, MPEs are used in a variety of ways. For example, some connect mission partners across a vast geographical area and a diverse number of cultures and languages.  Others allow partners to work together to analyze data to determine risks to life safety. Without question, MPEs are vitally important to fostering collaboration and communication to all users. In the United States as well as in other nations, defense leaders are using diplomacy as a means of tactical intelligence. MPEs securely, and in real-time, facilitate this essential brand of communication and coordination. As data volumes grow and as the types of data shared between combatant commands becomes more varied and more complex, defense leaders will increasingly rely on partners with knowledge of emerging technologies and a legacy understanding of the unique requirements of MPEs. At GDIT, we believe our established and proven performance in this space positions us especially well to design MPEs that reflect both the future of technology and the future of global diplomacy.

DIGITAL MODERNIZATION comprehensive approach to IT service management (ITSM) and its implementation within a federal government context. We have identified several best practices to enable this collaborative approach. Here are some of the key insights we have gathered. Focus on Value Focusing on value incentivizes both service providers and the government to share a common set of goals and objectives that directly result in benefits to the government. In order to have a focus on value, it is essential to define a comprehensive understanding of what value is within an organization. A typical mistake is to confuse the terms outputs, outcomes, and value. Unlike outputs and outcomes, value is the perceived benefit, usefulness, and importance of something. A project team’s output may be that it builds a dozen servers within eight hours. The outcome of that work is that the servers are then configured in support of a web- based application that users connect to and use successfully. The value, however, may be that the additional capacity from the new servers means users can analyze data and provide results in two hours instead of four, which reduces labor hours expended by 50 percent. “ Knowing the difference between outputs, outcomes, and value – and placing the appropriate focus on value – can go a long way toward effectively shaping and scoping projects and measuring their success over time.  ” Andrew McNamara Andrew McNamara Solutions Director, Digital Modernization, GDIT Prioritize the Customer Experience Customer Experience has come into greater focus in recent years. A recent executive order titled Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery To Rebuild Trust in Government was intended to recommit agencies to “being of the people, by the people, and for the people in order to solve the complex 21st century challenges our nation faces.” It’s GDIT’s belief that this focus will help agencies deliver services more effectively and equitably with a smooth end user experience that facilitates mission success and satisfaction. We follow three primary recommendations to drive the focus on customer experience: Persona and Employee Journey Mapping. Personas address the human factors, roles, and situational environments that different types of users’ face. Journeys illustrate the thoughts, feelings, and actions of employees across multiple channels to understand how they operate, what opportunities exist, and how to coordinate digital and non-digital solutions to improve the experience. With knowledge from both personas and journeys, teams can create customer experiences that cater to the unique needs of their stakeholders, audiences, and users. Experience Level Agreements (XLAs). XLAs help to derive customer and user sentiment beyond traditional survey approaches by measuring actual user performance in real-time across one or more established use cases. These measurements provide rich and insightful information to teams and to agencies and can often uncover areas of opportunity that can be transformative. Service Owners. One common, but successful approach that we have seen, in terms of focusing on the customer experience, is the concept of service owners. Together with a service manager, the service owner is ultimately accountable for end-to-end service delivery, while the manager is responsible for it. This creates an understanding that there are interdependencies between other services and IT towers. At the same time, it can inform how teams work within and across an organization. Leverage Service Integration & Management Service integration and management (SIAM) is an industry approach that provides guidance on how to manage multiple service providers. Beyond merely managing providers from a contractual perspective, SIAM integrates them to provide end-to-end services based on government outcomes and objectives. For the successful implementation of SIAM, we have five key recommendations: Maintain governance – meaning, if an independent third-party is leveraged responsibility over governance must still be retained by the government. Adopt a shared risk model, which includes outcomes-based and value-oriented service level agreements that call for objective assessments of how well providers are meeting their obligations. Provide incentives to foster effective collaboration to help set expectations and facilitate teamwork and cooperation across vendors. Establish a robust organizational change management (OCM) program, which will increase the likelihood and speed of project success and show a significant return on investment. Foster collegial relationships among providers such as by structuring the project management office (PMO) to be an integration point and hosting regular roundtables among vendors to facilitate relationship building, mutual interest and joint problem solving. As the technology landscape and mission requirements evolve rapidly, GDIT understands how important it is for agencies to take a collective approach to ITSM in order to facilitate collaboration and drive success across programs, contracts, and the enterprise. A focus on value, prioritizing the customer experience and leveraging service integration and management are core ways to make collaborative ITSM a reality and to maximize its potential within agencies.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE"," ChatGPT, and before it, DALL-E and other generative artificial intelligence tools, are certainly “generating” a lot of attention, and they’re changing the way we think about AI, what it can do and how it can help us. For many people, the focus is on what these tools can do well and how they can accelerate certain tasks. We’d argue that we should also consider what these tools can’t yet do well and how they can help us perform certain tasks better,  if   not faster. OUR CAPABILITIES OUR CAPABILITIES Learn more about our work with Artificial Intelligence. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE Paired programming is one such example. In its simplest form, paired programming involves pairing two programmers, one of whom codes and one of whom observes, reviewing each line of code as it’s written. The two programmers switch roles at prescribed intervals. The idea was that this method would reduce errors, promote creative problem solving and generally result in better end products. In reality, paired programming was labor-intensive and not how most developers preferred to work. However, Open AI’s Code Ex, one generative AI tool, makes paired programming both possible and more palatable. It generates code just as a developer would, but it’s a collaboration tool. With correct prompts from a person, it can perform certain parts of the software development process faster and with a bottomless knowledge of existing datasets, libraries, and methodologies that no human can match. It overcomes any learning curve or research time that a human would require. Say, for example, you’re working on a migration project that needs lots of data. Code Ex can generate the entire mock data generator program. It couldn’t do any of it without instructions from a developer who knows how to write migration software, who can manage the development process and who can recognize errors in the code. But in the hands of great developers, Code Ex can be that paired programming partner who makes applications better. Just as with ChatGPT, Code Ex will generate a lot of errors.  And also just like ChatGPT, when it is wrong, it is confidently wrong.  But with the right prompts, it can generate code that can be instructive about how to write better prompts, feed into the generate-refine-iterate- refine process and, ultimately, deliver a better product. For some mundane development tasks, Code Ex can accelerate development. If prompted well, it saves a lot of typing (and typos). But perhaps its real value is that it helps developers to choose the best tool for a problem, and it helps them to use unfamiliar tools that perhaps they didn’t even know existed. This is a far more important benefit than work acceleration. It helps developers build better solutions and it helps make application code better. It compresses learning curves. It brings deep knowledge to development teams. And, because it is so reliant on well-crafted prompts, it drives specificity and intention into the development process. Generative AI as a technology is not mature enough to generate production code by itself. It should only be thought of as a tool for human developers—not dissimilar from version control tools (e.g. Git), integrated development environments (IDEs), and code frameworks. In fact, Generative AI tools now combine seamlessly with IDEs and Git, and agencies should experiment with how these tools fit into their existing development processes and toolsets. Just as DALL-E won’t replace artists and illustrators and ChatGPT won’t replace writers and communicators, Code Ex won’t replace developers. Quite the opposite, it will become a good partner with which –  not with whom  – to do paired programming. When used effectively, it can be an indispensable part of the development process.

LEARN MORE enhanced mission continuity. Doing it poorly can have disastrous consequences in the other direction. GDIT uses simple but impactful heuristic data analytics to maintain a custodial account of how, for example, end components in a data center are used so that we can proactively replace equipment or parts before they fail and accurately forecast the precise moment at which to do so. To do it, we look at things like the mean time between failures, or MTBF, of every component. Then considering the on-board sensor data including usage, vibrations and others metrics that are built into today’s systems and sub-systems. We know how the MBTF varies across manufacturers or in certain environments or temperatures, and we know how each piece of equipment is being used – e.g., is it running 24 hours a day? Is it running over-temperature 80% of the time? How do run-times and temperature affect MBTF? We look at metrics like time to live, or TTL, and similarly forecast how long data will live on a network, how much traffic is on a network and how that taxes the network’s infrastructure overall. With all of this information we can use algorithms against the data to model when whole pieces of equipment or component parts will need to be replaced.  We can then overlay that data with supply chain data – e.g., how long will it take to get something, and when can we get to the customer site to replace it – and plan our procurement schedule accordingly. Just as important, with all of this real-world data and manufacturer data, we can also predict and plan for potential failures and mitigate them before they happen. This adds enhanced mission continuity to a project and also lets us perform resource planning that tells us which team resources will need to be in which customer locations to perform the maintenance.  All of this data, because we are proactively tracking and forecasting it, allows us to be a better, more effective and more efficient partner to customers. Without question, artificial intelligence and machine learning are generating a lot of buzz and attention – and have been for years. But solid analytics, done well and done consistently, can generate significant positive impacts for programs just the same. It enhances up-time, generates certainty of costs and resource planning, saves money and can dramatically impact mission delivery. GDIT supports contracts that involve much of this at a massive scale and scope, so when considering headcount, cost and physical infrastructure – this type of heuristic analysis is essential. It involves methodical data collection, monitoring, modeling and planning, but it can have tremendous returns.

OUR CAPABILITIES OUR CAPABILITIES Learn more about GDIT’s cybersecurity portfolio. CYBER Defend Critical Infrastructure The National Cyber Strategy emphasizes the need to defend critical infrastructure, from energy to water systems, against cyber threats. Agencies should prioritize the adoption of minimum cybersecurity requirements across critical sectors to ensure national security and public safety. As they plan future investments, modernizing operational technology systems and adopting best practices to safeguard critical infrastructure will be crucial. Embracing zero trust architectures, endpoint detection and response capabilities, secure supply chain practices, are essential steps towards enhancing cyber defense capabilities. Disrupt and Dismantle Threat Actors To counter the increasing sophistication of cyber adversaries, the strategy advocates for a proactive approach, leveraging all instruments of national power. Collaborative efforts between agencies and the Department of Justice, Department of Defense, and US Cyber Command will be vital to disrupting adversaries and addressing the ransomware threat. Building strong partnerships with the private sector will create a united front against adversaries. Shape Market Forces to Drive Security and Resilience The strategy aims to shift the burden of cybersecurity away from individuals and small businesses by placing greater responsibility on organizations best positioned to reduce risk. As a result, agencies are focusing on promoting privacy, data security, and establishing liability for software products and services. The strategy has an increase focus on software security and reducing vulnerabilities to ensure software products and services should have secure development practices. Invest in a Resilient Future The rapid pace of technological innovation necessitates strategic investments in research and development to maintain U.S. leadership in secure, next-generation technologies. Agencies are prioritizing R&D in areas like post-quantum encryption, digital identity solutions, and clean energy infrastructure. Developing a diverse and robust national cyber workforce is essential to meeting the ever-growing demand for skilled cybersecurity professionals. Forge International Partnerships to Pursue Shared Goals With the global nature of cyber threats, the National Cyber Strategy underscores the importance of international collaboration in fostering a more secure cyberspace. By working closely with allies and partners, agencies will be better positioned to counter threats, build capacity, and develop secure, reliable supply chains for information and communications technology and operational technology products and services. As the National Cyber Strategy is implemented, agencies may face funding challenges and increased liability for failure to address cyber issues. Mission partners can help agencies navigate the changing cybersecurity landscape.

MPE Establishing Connections in Even the Most Challenging & Complex Environments Perhaps nowhere is the challenge of building and supporting MPEs greater than in the United States Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM) region, one of six geographic combatant commands. The USINDOPACOM area of responsibility is the largest, geographically, and it shares a border with each of the other five. It is culturally, socially, economically, and geopolitically diverse and consists of 36 nations, spans nine time zones, and thousands of miles. In this region, MPEs are indispensable in supporting information sharing between the U.S and its partners. This sharing occurs through software, hardware and integrated processes designed to foster strategic and tactical collaboration through the intelligence data exchange. When implementing new MPEs, we work closely with partner nations in the region. The mission involves surveying locations and materials and then building out a local MPE environment. We ensure the proper connectivity and infrastructure is in place to allow for stable and secure communications among defense and intelligence leaders. In this way, our experience, understanding of the mission and technological expertise enables us to design, build and implement MPEs with partners. In the USINDOPACOM region in particular, we leverage satellites, cloud technology and commercial cabling secured by the U.S. Command. The mission demands security best practices across Zero Trust, Identity Credentialing and Access Management (ICAM), and diverse data collection and management tools to enable the kind of information sharing necessary within an MPE. Evolving Threats Mean Evolving Approaches to the Work The threats in the USINDOPACOM region are many, and our work has never been more important. We are constantly deploying new and emerging technologies, strengthening our security posture, expanding to new partners, and leveraging our experience to create the MPE of the future. Most recently, the team confronted the challenges inherent to the region alongside the challenges of COVID-19. The pandemic put a spotlight on the value of MPEs and what we do, and why countries need this type of secure, virtual communication both in wartime and in peace time. As the global trend toward coalitions continues, the United States is doing a lot jointly and in partnership with allies around the world to advance our shared interests and collective security. GDIT is proud to be a trusted mission partner helping to ensure the United States remains at the forefront of MPE development and support. We look forward to continuing to support and evolve this critical work in a complex and essential region.

Yet today, NATO partners and even each of the different services often use different networks and devices that are not interoperable to communicate. This is the impetus for the DoD’s JADC2 initiative, which consolidates signal communications among joint forces and makes everything more interoperable. OUR CAPABILITIES OUR CAPABILITIES Learn more about 5G and how GDIT is helping customers in this space. LEARN MORE JADC2 and 5G Complement JADC2 is a replacement for the constellation of legacy purpose-built tools  that add additional complexity and – from a cybersecurity perspective – unintentionally broaden the threat landscape on which our adversaries will look to attack.  But the signal issue is not unique to the  Defense arena . Managing spectrum traffic and devices is a critical way to minimize potential interference amid legacy radio usage within the aerospace, telecom, and healthcare industries. As a DoD example, current radios provide limited support for controlling devices traveling at hypersonic speed. The U.S. doesn’t have operational hypersonic missiles yet, but it’s a top priority. According to the Government Accountability Office, funding for hypersonic research increased by 740% between 2015 and 2020. The 2022 defense budget alone increased funding by 20%. Managing and intercepting hypersonic devices will require the ultra-low latency 5G provides. This is a must have for manned and unmanned teaming (MUMT), which pairs manned and unmanned autonomous devices for enhanced mission delivery. Connecting operators, drones, and other vehicles all with 5G’s high-band, near-zero latency capability, along with operating on and through existing commercial networks in partner nations, would be a competitive advantage against peer and near peer adversaries . It would also form the underlying infrastructure for enabling JADC2 and coordinating with NATO and partner nations. An analog to this, no pun intended, would be to consider American troops in Europe in World War II. They didn’t rebuild roads to trek across Europe. They used what was there and built new roads or rebuilt bombed-out bridges when they needed to. The same applies here. 5G Drives Security Additionally, GPS and satellite-based communications are increasingly vulnerable to new threats from space junk to rouge nation missiles. If satellite-based time and location information is jeopardized it can potentially put missions and, more importantly, warfighters at risk. 5G can be an important and life-saving alternative. 5G has the ability to support faster, near-real-time decision making within the DoD enterprise  facilitating JADC2 allowing relevant information to be shared from in garrison to the tactical edge and back.  It can link multiple systems together and promote real-time information sharing, enhancing communications across the board. “ The military needs 5G and high bandwidth to support new and emerging threats and use cases from increasingly sophisticated near-peer and rogue state adversaries.  ” Michael Zurat Michael Zurat Senior Solutions Architect To be sure, a 5G future for the DoD requires navigating technical complexities like spectrum sharing, radio frequency masking and electronic warfare concerns in addition to infrastructure sharing and virtualization of networks and cellular cores. But the benefits outweigh the challenges and moving to the first truly global and international wireless standard is important not only for the enhanced capabilities but also for the cost savings of using commercially available components vs. often decades old legacy equipment. GDIT Helps Customers Plan for a 5G Future Today, GDIT is helping customers plan for the impending 5G future.  As an example, we’re implementing our 5G flight line of the future solution for the U.S. Air Force as part of its Base Information Transport Infrastructure (BITI) Reset program at McConnell Air Force Base in Wichita, Kansas. In 2022 mechanics and technicians will use 5G connectivity to facilitate repair and maintenance in the hanger and across the airfield. The base’s WiFi 6 and 5G network provide coverage for flight crews and other staff on the ground who use tablets to manage flight line operations, ramps, parking locations, hangars, maintenance facilities and more. This infrastructure will enable future 5G- connected aircraft sensors to automate and manage aircraft support, maintenance and supply chain logistics as well as connect augmented reality devices for enhanced guidance for technicians. We’re also members of the Joint Base San Antonio 5G working group and have  established the GDIT Emerge Lab at our headquarters in Falls Church, VA  where we operate a 5G environment for testing and demonstrations of various technology. The lab is one way we support our customers by convening and training skilled talent, assessing emerging 5G solutions, and working with partners to innovate and rapidly develop new ones. Additionally, we work with market leaders across the 5G industry who rely on feedback from our Emerge lab and our customer sites to improve their technology, better serve customers, and advance the mission.

Today, we are supporting the large combat employment exercise called “Coalition Virtual Flag” (CVF). The exercise gives participants the opportunity to interact with Joint and Coalition forces and with joint elements of the Theater Air Control System. DMOC enables Virtual Flag participants to link to geographically separated joint units, allowing each to interact with one another via simulators. “ CVF benefits the warfighter by giving them the unique ability to work face-to-face with joint and coalition partners that they don’t’ normally get in a live environment. This venue gives them the ability to have face- to-face contact from planning all the way to execution… which makes them a better warfighter. ” Coalition Virtual Flag Participant Coalition Virtual Flag Participant Over the last two years especially, DMO training has proven to be extremely valuable as the pandemic limits travel and interactions. The DMOC has played a critical role in supporting this type of learning and ensuring that there were minimal limitations on simulation-style training amid the crisis.

Recently, I had the pleasure of sitting down with Todd Isaacs, GDIT’s chief innovation officer. We agreed that while “innovation” is a term that’s sometimes overused, there is value in defining it as an organization and letting that definition consistently shape how you approach everything from team structures to technical stacks, to customer challenges and mission delivery. Below are some of my favorite insights from our discussion: Innovation comes in many forms. Cutting edge technologies and inventions often come to mind when we talk about innovation, but it’s far broader. Whether cultural, strategic, technological or beyond, organizations can strengthen themselves by recognizing different sources and types of ideas, and then shepherding them through the vetting, prioritization and implementation life cycle. People are the key to generating consistent, meaningful innovation. Our discussion, not surprisingly, often returned to the idea that properly motivated and engaged people are the key to innovation in any organization. Todd talked about the way that GDIT works with intent to build a culture of innovation, starting from the recruitment process and extending all the way to company leadership. He talked about the value in recruiting people who are passionate about innovation and then creating pathways for them to grow and advance. Similarly, he talked about the onus on leadership to create an environment of trust wherein people with ideas can trust their leaders to be good stewards of their ideas. Harness the inherently chaotic nature of change to create a self-sustaining culture of innovation. Todd and his team do a lot of work to establish and implement processes and structures that invite ideas from anywhere and allow those ideas to move through the organization. He pointed to “idea registries” that encourage anyone to innovate and to be supported as they share their ideas. Todd also talked about Shark Tank-style competitions that allow technical and program managers to hear from others about potential innovation opportunities and to have them prioritized based on impact and resources and then put into an innovation funnel – beginning with research and leading to prototypes with transparency throughout. Identify the potential impact of an innovation and then act quickly to implement it. Todd also reminded me that innovation can involve taking existing tools and combining them in a new way, rather than developing something from scratch. He pointed to an intern-led project that came out of the Covid-19 pandemic. He recalled how a team of interns combined existing collaboration technologies widely in use at GDIT for well over two years. The team created a tool to condense meetings into a more ingestible format for those unable to attend. The tool creates a PDF of a meeting’s slides, pairs it with a transcript noting who was talking when, captures action items and next steps. It was presented internally and well received by GDIT teams. Again, innovation doesn’t have to mean creating something new. It’s about working with the tools you have to do more than you imagined you could. DIGITAL CONSULTING I always walk away with new thoughts and questions percolating when I get the chance to speak with Todd. I found our discussion both interesting and inspiring, and I hope you’ll appreciate his thoughts as well. Let us know if you have anything to add to the conversation in the comments!

Modern supply chain engineering and logistics can be traced back to WWII, when the U.S. government developed a system to get supplies and equipment to troops spread throughout the world quickly and efficiently. Supply chain engineering and logistics have drastically changed since, in large part thanks to e-commerce, the desire for self-service procurement, and the rapid growth of purchase order transactions. Because of these factors, consumers have become more vulnerable to data risks. Vulnerabilities to data risks have led bad actors to pounce on weak links along the complicated supply chain. These bad actors have had long-term effects on both corporations and government entities – with recent attacks racking up  nearly $100 billion in repairs . It’s imperative users constantly check risks associated with their supply chain. Without constant monitoring, entities can be left exposed. Moving Software Procurement to the Cloud Cloud has increased the modernization velocity at agencies, but the way software is procured has not evolved at the same pace. CIOs and developers alike want to increase the pace of cloud adoption, reduce approval times, and leverage industry-standard solutions. Finance and procurement personnel want to focus on cost effectiveness and acquisition simplicity. However, one of the greatest hurdles to these goals is governance and compliance. Managing multiple cloud-based product subscriptions and entitlements across an agency or program is an intensive process, from obtaining the necessary security and compliance certifications to controlling costs as the number of child accounts grow. “Many federal agencies are struggling with cloud adoption, especially finding and deploying the right mission-enabling software to run on top of the cloud,” said Mathew Soltis, vice president of cloud at General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT). A Secure Government Depends on a Secure Supply Chain The recent Executive Order on cybersecurity calls for new criteria to evaluate the security practices of software developers and suppliers, and for the development of new tools to demonstrate conformance with secure practices. The Office of Management and Budget, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and the National Security Agency, have all recently released guidance around securing the software supply chain. The private sector, which has more flexibility in procurement, has access to digital marketplace solutions that allow company IT teams to rapidly and securely introduce these solutions. These solutions are now coming to government agencies through GDIT’s AWS Private Marketplace. “GDIT’s AWS Private Marketplace offers an end-to-end supply chain with the ability to find, subscribe, deploy and govern third-party software and solutions all in one place,” Soltis said. “Marketplace was designed for speed while also unlocking innovation with features that streamline procurement, automate provisioning, implement controls, and enable teams and their missions.” To prevent exposure to bad actors, agencies should plan ahead and be aware of possible disruptions to the supply chain. “Agencies need to build a strong relationship with their suppliers – it’s crucial to do this before supply chain issues start,” said Ken Bailey, senior business development manager at AWS. “If you know how your supplier operates, who they interact with, who they deliver to, and what their business practices are, you are more likely to have more visibility into potential threats. By exposing risk earlier, entities can make sure they are taking the correct steps to manage supply chain risk.” CLOUD Bringing Commercial and Emerging Tech with Government Many agencies are already running cloud-native tools, but they need to complement those tools either with open source or third-party software. And to get that software, they need to procure it, buy it, install it themselves and manage it. “GDIT’s AWS Private Marketplace has cloud-based solutions from thousands of independent software vendors,” said Soltis. “Procurement teams can quickly and easily refine catalogs to make agency-approved software and applications available to program teams through this Marketplace.” Software is scanned for security compliance and billing, and metering and usage for paid software is integrated into the AWS customer bill. It allows customers to move quickly. The platform provides a channel that documents attestations for secure development environments, such as the use of encryption, and appropriate monitoring and logging for those critical software components. “By having identity and access management integrated into the GDIT’s AWS Marketplace, administrators can control not only who has the permission to access Marketplace, but also who has the ability to authorize procurements,” Bailey said. Bridging Compliance with Innovation Technology plays a leading role in the increase of cyber threats in the supply chain, but the same innovative technology is essential to driving critical agency missions forward. Governments need access to innovative technology that also focus on governance and compliance, as they relate to acquisition, in this case for software on the cloud. To adhere to federal acquisition regulations (FAR), GDIT evaluates suppliers and subcontractors for risk, including cyber security risk, prior to point of procurement, Soltis notes. This enables appropriate monitoring and preventive action throughout the supplier life cycle. The cloud by itself has several benefits to offer: it’s elastic, scalable and gives agencies the enhanced capabilities to accomplish goals. “Treat cloud as a mission enabler to enhance your core capabilities, and you start to see all the components necessary to ensure you are leveraging cloud to its fullest potential for your agency,” said Bailey.

OUR CAPABILITIES OUR CAPABILITIES Learn more about GDIT’s modernization work, including our focus on VOI. MANAGED SERVICES ROI can be calculated as the sum of the cost savings (usually labor) divided by the sum of the costs to build and implement a solution. And although there are many ways to ascertain ROI, they all focus on this ratio of savings versus cost of services. Rather, the Value on Investment (VOI) model measures the real-world value of innovations and modernization activities. Looking only at ROI provides a singular view of costs, but misses the bigger picture of the true value of an initiative – one seen by the person, team, or organization that the initiative was ultimately designed to benefit. Efficiency + Agility = Mission Impact VOI provides a wider view for an organization, deriving overall value of the innovations, optimizations, or modernizations being implemented. Importantly, the VOI calculation intersects the traditional ROI metric with the efficiency and agility gains afforded to the mission. Efficiency Efficiency  incorporates speed to complete a task, the continual optimization of services, and the improvement in the customer experience. Agility Agility  is the ability to rapidly pivot to changing mission requirements. Together, efficiency and agility enhance decision-making, inject critical thought throughout the analytical process, and improve response time to address mission needs when selecting new or updating existing capabilities. Many benefits can be gained to the mission across efficiency and agility valuations. Every project should be focused on delivering mission value. While ROI is still important, the conversation about real-world value on the investment is an essential one to view a more holistic image of impact to the mission.

OUR CAPABILITIES OUR CAPABILITIES Learn more about what we offer and our full suite of cyber capabilities. CYBER Yet, while these challenges confront us today, there is little evidence to suggest they’ll be gone tomorrow. That’s why agencies are increasingly turning to managed security service providers, or MSSPs, to provide a standardized, proven model for cybersecurity services. What’s a Managed Security Services Provider? MSSPs are essentially outsourced cybersecurity services. They are a dedicated organization focused on providing cyber expertise to customers. Agencies utilizing MSSPs share the cost of services and resources, rather than paying for direct, dedicated resources for the organization, MSSPs provide 24x7x365 security operations coverage from experts who can quickly detect an issue, respond, and remediate while optimizing performance. MSSPs also provide support for agency system and organization controls audits, threat hunting, and incident response and surge support. Delivery models vary from subscription-based to as-needed  and can result in substantial cost-savings alongside a significant improvement in an agency’s security posture. Why Do I Need One? There are many reasons an agency may choose to use an MSSP.  Cost and time savings, as mentioned above, are two big reasons. Other considerations can be just as impactful. For example, governing bodies like Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) are now requiring agencies meet complex security strategies and compliance requirements. Large and small agencies alike struggle to adequately secure their networks and to be compliant with various new mandates and requirements. An MSSP can help. Another reason: MSSPs free up staff to focus more directly on the mission. An MSSP can tackle an agency’s Tier 1, 2 or 3 security operations center (SOC) monitoring, for example, allowing agency staff to focus on more complex tasks, or ones that require direct attention such as threat-hunting, red team exercises, and more. Finally, an agency can benefit from the economies of scale that MSSPs introduce. MSSPs standardize a level of response with proven people, processes, reporting and technology with agreed upon service level agreements (SLAs) to meet an organization’s objectives. Additionally, an agency can tailor their MSSP to onboard a subset of cybersecurity services, depending upon maturity and readiness. How Can I Get Started? Agencies looking to move to an MSSP should consider where they are with their technology stack and existing contracts. Ensuring an agency is ready to onboard both the MSSP people and technology is equally important. MSSPs can represent a lot of change – albeit good change – and part of the process involves managing that change and navigating the perceived yet incorrect perception of losing control. In reality, in an MSSP model, an agency hands the execution of cybersecurity tasks to the MSSP, without relinquishing control. GDIT as an MSSP currently supports more than 80 state, local, and federal agencies. Our team of more than 180 highly skilled professionals hold more than 600 certifications in cybersecurity and technology and offer clients support across everything from SOC monitoring to cyber engineering to disaster recovery to compliance to governance to risk management and more. We help our customers achieve tremendous savings and tremendous enhancements to their overall cybersecurity posture.  Partnering with our customers in this way has proven to be incredibly impactful to their missions  and to their overall security posture.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE But amid the buzz, there are boosters, detractors, and realists. ChatGPT is one of many text-to-text generative AI tools and there are some who say it’s not even one of the best. For agencies looking to determine how or whether to use ChatGPT or another generative AI tool, there are a number of considerations to help guide your thinking. Chat GPT Needs Training on Related Information & Specific Prompts First, the quality of a ChatGPT response is determined by two key factors: whether it has been trained on related information and the specificity of the prompt. Domain-specific information, such as specific terms or contextual meanings, requires additional model training and tuning. As for prompts, the more detailed, the better the response will be. Think of ChatGPT as a Google search that generates answers in full text, as opposed to links. And like a search, not all ChatGPT responses are accurate. ChatGPT’s responses are well crafted text – they read well – but they may be absolutely wrong. At GDIT, we used ChatGPT to ask detailed technical questions and achieved very good results. Some of our prompts included: How do I containerize a predictive model for deployment to an edge device? How do I train a predictive model given a highly skewed distribution of target outcomes? How do I remove bias from training data when training a classifier? Again, we were impressed with the results but were on the lookout for errors and missed context. Test and Explore, And Proceed with Caution Like any other tool, ChatGPT is limited to what it knows and has been trained on. And it has been trained to predict and generate content based on billions of example texts. It cannot understand inferences in language. It can’t do math. It can’t perform logic. In one example discussed on a recent edition of New York Times reporter Ezra Klein’s podcast, ChatGPT was asked about “the gender of the first female president.” Any human reading that question would come to the logical conclusion that the gender of the first female president will be … female. Instead, ChatGPT gave a response about assumptions, equality, and gender as a construct. The response was very inclusive, articulate and well composed but it was, at the end of the day, incorrect. This is something that concerns many people about generative AI – at least in its early stages, as we are in today. ChatGPT can be persuasive, regardless of whether it is correct. The idea that incorrect content will be accepted as truth and be used to create false advertising and misinformation is a scenario that is not too difficult to imagine. Clear Test Cases for Agency R&D Teams Despite the limitations and concerns, there are clear opportunities where ChatGPT has the potential to positively transform how agencies get work done, just as with automation several years ago. Agencies looking to evaluate ChatGPT today, and perhaps other generative AI tools in the future, should test out these tools across a variety of use cases. As examples, agencies can ask ChatGPT detailed technical questions and gauge the results. They can use it to generate or debug code, or to detect security issues in code. ChatGPT can perform service desk or help desk chat basics, and it can generate scripts to containerize code, deploy a virtual machine, run scans, or perform other repetitive configuration tasks. It can also reverse engineer shellcode and much, much more. To be certain, the AI in ChatGPT is good and ready to use today, but it can get better. And it will. That’s the wonderful thing about where we are today as it relates to generative AI. There are so many emerging new tools, and there will be many more to come. Before ChatGPT was all the rage with text, DALL-E got the same buzz for images. No matter the tool, AI will always be an accelerator and a quality enhancer, but it will never be able to give us answers to every imaginable problem. There will always be a market for human ingenuity, and when it is combined with technology like AI and others, we really start to delve into the art of the possible.

This month I was honored to be invited to participate in a panel discussion at the Homeland Security Enterprise Forum in Washington. The theme of the event was “Security Through Partnership,” and throughout its three-day course it convened leaders from business, government, and academia to discuss how to, simply put, better protect American national security interests at home and abroad. My panel was on quantum computing and the threats and opportunities it poses to security. I shared the stage with representatives from Amazon Web Services, MITRE Corporation and In-Q-Tel, the intelligence community’s investment arm. The crux of our discussion centered on the idea that while there is tremendous opportunity in quantum  – for everyone from pharmaceutical companies to energy providers to financial services firms – there is also tremendous risk. From a national security and homeland security perspective, it’s important to understand both the risks and benefits of quantum, as well as how to use it in order to not be caught flat-footed by our adversaries. From cybersecurity to data integrity, to communications and sensing technology, we can expect huge quantum-enabled capability gains. We can also expect that bad actors and nation states alike are availing themselves of these new capabilities. Look no further than China’s “collect now, decrypt later” approach. It’s therefore imperative that national and homeland security professionals be as knowledgeable as possible about quantum, about emerging quantum technologies and how to use them – and defend against them – within their agencies.

ICAM solution in a Denied, Disrupted, Intermittent, and Limited bandwidth (DDIL) environment. More specifically, GDIT demonstrated interoperability and synchronization with the enterprise environment using a robust 5G connection, then simulated battlefield DDIL conditions by disconnecting from the 5G network.  By empowering data sharing decisions in a DDIL environment, completely independent of the enterprise capability, GDIT showcased the ability to deploy our zero trust capabilities at the edge, while still conforming to DoD standards. The event’s theme was  “From Data to Dominance Through Partnerships.”  Working with our partners, including participation by units representing US Army Pacific (USARPAC), USINDOPACOM and NOAA, GDIT’s participation in the Technology Incubation Demonstration Experimentation Support (TIDES) exercise represents the in-field demonstration of a tactical edge  zero trust  solution that federates identities with mission partner environments and across the enterprise. Bringing Enterprise Capabilities to the Edge The GDIT Edge ICAM solution provides warfighters with the ability to share data securely with mission partners in the battlefield. Our solution aggregates identities from disparate data environments and stores identity data using a standardized schema. This allows mission commanders to have a common identity repository to decide when and with whom to share mission critical data, even when the partners come from outside our own environment. GDIT also incorporated quantum-resistant encryption with our partner, Fornetix, to secure voice and video conferencing communications to enable tactical collaboration. By enabling secure data sharing and access control of resources in the field, our Edge ICAM solution supports the warfighters’ need to access mission-relevant data and make data-driven decisions in the field to drive victory. This exercise also showed how we can bring new users and developers into an intelligence community environment by generating these aforementioned controls both in the field and on the fly. We can manage and federate solutions with new mission partners in an ad hoc environment and allow users to dynamically share data to affect a mission from the tactical edge, without connectivity to the enterprise. Origins and Strategic Value of TIDES The University of Hawaii’s Applied Research Lab is a U.S. Navy-sponsored university-affiliated research environment that serves as a center of excellence for critical Navy and national defense needs. There, teams conduct research, develop solutions, and test and evaluate them to address both existing and emerging national defense challenges. In 2020, this center of excellence established TIDES, which is a platform where innovative technologies can be incubated, tested, and assessed in operationally relevant environments. That same year, they began inviting companies and mission partners to take part in exercises to demonstrate their capabilities in the TIDES environment. TIDES provides a realistic, uncontrolled setting for program sponsors, technologists, and users to work together to accelerate critically necessary advancements in warfighter support. Aligned and Accelerating JADC2 The demonstration of our edge ICAM solution is directly aligned with the Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) initiative, which prioritizes connecting data, sensors, and other communications devices across all the services. It facilitates secure information-sharing at the speed of the mission, in mission-critical environments. “We are accelerating and, with exercises like these, leveraging our investments in GDIT technology capabilities to deliver and then redefine the art of the possible,” GDIT Chief Technology Officer Ben Gianni said. “Proven demonstrations underscore that we are delivering advanced technology and enterprise-class capabilities to the warfighter that affect today’s mission success.""

But what is it? OUR CAPABILITIES OUR CAPABILITIES Learn more about how GDIT performs essential external attack surface monitoring for customers. CYBER," External attack surface monitoring is critically important to GDIT customers.  But what is it? OUR CAPABILITIES OUR CAPABILITIES Learn more about how GDIT performs essential external attack surface monitoring for customers. CYBER Simply put, your external attack surface is what attackers see when they look at your organization. It includes your physical networks, cloud, third-party services and even your supply chain. Protecting this surface is complex because the surface itself is dynamic and changing all the time. Add to that, the tools and methods at a cybercriminal’s disposal are also complex and changing all the time. The attack surface for agencies is also rapidly expanding, driven by more remote devices, apps, and the move to the cloud. This is why a holistic approach to monitoring your external attack surface is so important. And there are five practical, actionable things decision makers can do to shore up their defenses. 1. Understand What You’re Monitoring Presently Teams should start by understanding and, if necessary, evolving their current monitoring approach. We call this defining the potential attack surface. Are you monitoring everything? Do you have the full picture of where your risk is? Are you satisfied with what you’re doing? Are your vulnerability tests as comprehensive as they could be? It’s important to understand what networked assets you have and assess the overall health of your environment. 2. Take an Outside-in Look What does a cybercriminal see when they look at your organization? Where would they see an opportunity to attack? Taking this view of your entire attack surface can give you a new lens as to where there is room – and critical need – for improvement. A key component of zero trust  architecture is micro-segmentation, which divides workloads into logical segments, which are easier to secure and monitor. Cyber attackers also have a harder time making lateral movements if they do penetrate one of the segments. 3. Identify Assets in Need of Modernization Once you’ve taken a hard look at your organization, identify where there is a need for a new monitoring approach. For example tools used to monitor workloads in the cloud can be different from the tools used for monitoring physical systems. What is the need, how great is it, and how quickly could you make changes? It’s important for agencies to develop and effectively implement strategies and align investments that deliver security and enable their missions. 4. Prioritize Actions You can’t do everything at once. As agencies build and adopt zero trust strategies, we’re recommending they start with areas that need the most attention and make incremental improvements over time.  Decide what you’ll turn to next, and so on and so on. For many agencies, starting with a pilot and moving legacy systems into the new environment one at a time may make the process more manageable. This offers you a plan and a case to, if necessary, request the resources you’ll need to continue executing it. 5. Operationalize Apply any updated external attack surface monitoring tools and develop a process ongoing maintenance. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities enable IT teams to see how endpoints are accessing your network and data at a granular level. Establish an incident response strategy and inform all necessary stakeholders. Examine whether policy changes are needed and implement them as soon as possible. With new data from EDR, artificial intelligence can continuously look for irregular activity and automatically enforce policies when a threat is detected. These are real-world, repeatable steps that every organization can take to improve the security of its external attack surface. Observed recent intrusions took advantage of zero-day vulnerabilities, software supply chain attacks, ransomware, and exposed operational technology.  Attack surface monitoring capabilities are one way to empower the security operations team to gain comprehensive visibility and mitigations for possible exposures from threats targeting similar vulnerabilities. Every day, GDIT applies our knowledge and experience as part of comprehensive security operations for customers. We help them better understand their environments and risk, evaluate their entire attack surface, and stay abreast of new applications and technologies that can help protect their assets.

Together with our long-time partner  Cisco , GDIT recently examined how private networking can enable 5G for mission-critical activities. Our goal was to assist defense agencies, as well as others, as they further envision “the art of the possible,” and adopt new 5G capabilities. WHITE PAPER WHITE PAPER How Private 5G Enhances the DoD and Other Federal Agencies DOWNLOAD REPORT This is important because private 5G networks can enhance existing systems and capabilities and can also help to solve myriad challenges while at the same time delivering higher levels of efficiency and productivity, improving safety, and contributing to overall mission effectiveness. We published our findings in a new whitepaper titled, How Private 5G Enhances the DoD and Other Federal Agencies. Below are some of the paper’s key takeaways. Connecting Everything, Everywhere Secure and reliable connectivity are the underpinnings for many private 5G use cases with the technological capabilities for providing seamless operations in denied, degraded, intermittent, or limited bandwidth (DDIL) environments. Whether applications of private 5G be at home or abroad, 5G can deliver the reliable low latency and high-bandwidth necessary for a tactical edge use case, for example. Designed To Enhance Existing Systems A private 5G network can operate as its own independent network, however integrating 5G technology with existing systems presents the greatest value. Given that most facilities already have some form of networking, be it Wi-Fi and or wired connectivity, adding private 5G into the mix requires thoughtful planning and the right technology partners for integrating with existing systems. A private 5G network that is designed and built to integrate with existing networks offers fundamental advantages such as establishing common identity and policy profiles that will simplify and unify network operations. Trusted To Work Since Private 5G is meant to support mission critical operations, it must be designed with a zero-trust architecture. Zero trust has evolved into the preferred approach to cybersecurity. Much the way 4G transformed how people get from place to place, 5G’s performance enhancements will help enable a transformation of defense capabilities. With high reliability and low latency, 5G enables sensor-to-sensor communications, allowing AI-enhanced applications to process data at the edge, and this information can then be shared with other entities or sensors. Use Cases with Relevance Across Agencies Throughout the public sector there is a diverse array of needs and requirements ready to benefit from private 5G network solutions that combine simplicity with resiliency and security. While our focus was on the needs of the Department of Defense, we know other agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Veterans Affairs (VA), and the United States Postal Service (USPS) share similar, mission-critical delivery requirements. These types of use cases include: Designing And Planning for Today And Tomorrow Together, Cisco and GDIT have been supporting the public sector for more than 30 years and our teams understand that 5G and edge solutions are part of a larger ecosystem of tools/capabilities that must work together securely and seamlessly to deliver outcomes critical to our customers’ ability to meet mission objectives. Since private 5G is not a one-size-fits-all solution, it must be designed for the specific demands of the use case and customer. Agencies need security-first thinking with Zero Trust architecture and to establish a secure foundation for today and into the future that will enable them to plan for a future with 6G and beyond. Agencies can also remove the complexity by exploring private 5G as a service, which is cloud-managed, and customer controlled. The network remains the customer’s network, so the agency is always in control of the processes and operations while the hardware and software are maintained and managed externally. Finally, agencies should explore solutions that are designed to integrate with existing systems, that can unify digital assets across networks, that can evolve with their needs and that are right sized for their applications and use cases of today with the extensibility to grow To learn more about 5G and how agencies are using it, I encourage you to check out GDIT’s  Agency Guide to 5G , and to discover how GDIT and partners, like Cisco, help agencies plan their 5G futures, please visit  www.gdit.com/5G .

Accelerated Future: An Exponential Lens on Emerging Technology and Risk,"The pace of change in technology is exponential.

OUR CAPABILITIES"," “The pace of change will never be this slow again.” OUR CAPABILITIES OUR CAPABILITIES Learn more about GDIT’s technology capabilities, including our office of emerging technology. OUR CAPABILITIES This notable observation has been used recently by world leaders, technologists, futurists, and other public speakers to point to the dramatic and rapidly accelerating rate of change in our world. The pace of change in technology is exponential, but as humans, we tend to think about things linearly, for instance, it previously took decades and, sometimes, more than one lifetime, to witness significant global changes brought about by technology. Many inside and outside of the technology space are familiar with Moore’s Law and the Law of Accelerating Returns, concepts implying that computing power and technological progress double every two years. That is an exponential rate of progress. Technology advances and the ensuing disruption to economic systems, lifestyles, and government systems is occurring faster than ever, but even the current rate of change is as slow as it will ever be – future increases are likely to occur at even faster speeds. Many exponential technologies, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science, virtual and augmented reality, additive manufacturing, biotech, nanotech, blockchain, quantum computing, and nuclear fusion will continue developing at this pace not just because of singular discoveries or innovations, but because of (1) the collective and sustained investments of governments and industry in research and development, and more importantly, (2) convergence of technologies and the resulting impact on the effective rate of growth across technologies. For example, quantum computing promises to massively increase machine learning capabilities, which then permits faster progress in other affected technologies. Governments can now use AI and data analytics to scour public blockchains (such as the Bitcoin network) to identify criminal activity by finding correlations of IP addresses and meta data, or spotting anomalies in transactions. Gene therapy, DNA sequencing, molecular modeling, and identifying genome variants that may be associated with cancer risk may all be accelerated by machine learning, and we can expect to experience faster rates of discovery through high performance and quantum computing advancements. These advances will bring us closer to true precision medicine, in which individual therapies can be developed to treat specific issues in an individual patient, instead of applying a generic therapeutic regimen. It may seem hard to contemplate, but imagine commercializing nuclear fusion to realize nearly unlimited clean energy generation, achieved within 15 to 20 years. Again – that is the power of exponential technological progress. “ Due to the speed at which technology changes are occurring, to keep ahead of the curve, we must project what technologies may be in the future, not just focus on the technologies that are now in existence. ” Tim Gilday Tim Gilday Senior Director, Emerging Technology Enhanced Risks The bright potential future that could be realized through the exponential rate of technology advances is easy to grasp. But what about the downsides? And whose responsibility is it to safeguard against them? A small group of cyber hackers can – and have – shut down pipelines and launched denial of service attacks on hospitals. With every great leap in technology that affects our increasingly complex and interwoven global systems, a lone-wolf terrorist with access to the right tools could bring more severe and widespread destruction. When greater (and more connected) technology is in more people’s hands, what are the potential negative implications for business, especially technology companies? For governments? For society? At GDIT, we examine those concerns with the goal of developing tools and solutions to help mitigate those threats. As a federal government contractor, we help agencies use  artificial intelligence , for example, on everything from identifying risks, to  preventing cyberattacks , to predicting  network system maintenance, predicting potential outages, and identifying threat vectors . It’s essential that we do this work in a way that helps government agencies realize the full potential of AI but in a proactive way that aims to prevent damage, rather than fix it after it has occurred. We developed and conducted  research  with the Government Business Council to understand the state of AI deployments and advances in the federal government today. With industry and government consortiums, such as  ACT-IAC , we contributed to guidance for agencies evaluating potential risks and ethical implications of AI deployments, including assessing potential secondary and tertiary implications that might be overlooked when reviewing primary impacts. In projects that can have broad impacts, all stakeholders should take responsibility to help identify and mitigate unwanted impacts, not only system developers. There should be an evolving checklist of potential impact considerations prior to releasing an AI system into production, as well as an ongoing method to test results and unwanted impacts. GDIT is also working with government leaders to provide inputs on policy developments to help appropriately regulate emerging technologies. We are part of an industry consortium advising the government on emerging technology matters including the development of quantum computing cybersecurity responses, and the U.S. House of Representatives’ Judiciary Committee review of the intellectual property and copyright implications of non-fungible tokens (NFT). GDIT is taking an active role with the U.S. government and the IT industry to realize a future that we, as Americans and as global citizens, would want to see – in which we proactively decide how we use emerging technology and how we can regulate it to achieve the most beneficial outcomes. Due to the speed at which technology changes are occurring, to keep ahead of the curve, we must project what technologies may be in the future, not just focus on the technologies that are now in existence.

To avoid an attack, your defenses must be right 100 percent of the time. The hacker only must be right once. OUR CAPABILITIES OUR CAPABILITIES Learn more about GDIT’s approach to quantum computing for cyber, and about our cybersecurity portfolio overall. CYBER Quantum computing turns that all on its head.  Why?  Two reasons. First, quantum computers are exponentially more efficient than classical computers for certain problems and can support more advanced and complex compute applications.  The emergence of quantum as a compute resource for solving specific computing challenges is at the same time full of promise and peril. Second, some encryption algorithms being used today can be hacked with already-built quantum algorithms. For a long time, that was fine because there were not quantum computers big enough or fast enough to crack them (i.e., crypto-analytically relevant quantum computers or CRQC). But that’s changing. American adversaries are investing heavily in the quantum computing space, making the threat of quantum-based attacks against our encryption algorithms a much more compelling one. Moreover, we are reliant on encryption because the networks our data travel on can be intercepted. A persistent fear is that – even if bad actors can’t yet do anything with our data – they can harvest it now, store it, and play it back later. So, what are agencies to do in the face of this reality? As the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the Cybersecurity Infrastructure and Security Agency (CISA), and the National Security Agency (NSA) all advise, agencies should continue to conduct good cyber hygiene practices and not yet purchase enterprise quantum-resistant algorithm solutions, except for piloting and testing. NSA expects a transition to quantum resistant algorithms will take place by 2035 once a national standard is adopted. In the meantime, however, CNSA 1.0 and 2.0 algorithms offer the benchmarks for national security systems. Additionally, agencies should take stock of their cryptological assets and ensure they have confidence that their scans are not missing particular devices or data stores and connections to internet of things (IoT) and peripheral devices. Agencies should also ensure they have a clear understanding and rating of the criticality and sensitivity of the various sets of data within their organization. While all data is important, bandwidth and resource limitations do exist, so agencies must develop a road map that ensures the highest-sensitivity data is secured first. These are good practices in line with a  zero trust approach , but the quantum threat provides extra impetus for getting this done as soon as possible.  In addition, the White House issued a  national security memorandum  that set the requirements for federal agencies to prepare for this threat. GDIT has developed a framework to help agencies prepare for the quantum threat and navigate the new standards that will ultimately be issued for agencies to implement, which are expected from NIST by 2024. The GDIT Quantum Resilience Framework is a risk-based, post- quantum cryptography implementation approach. It includes these steps: Assess Risk Begin by looking at your overall encryption risk profile. Some algorithms will be severely impacted by quantum computing, and some will be less impacted. Agencies should know where they are in relation to the latest NIST encryption standards and understand the risks of not being up to date. Analyze Impact Examine what encryptions are used throughout your organization and what services they support. This can include web browsing, email, digital signatures, message digests, key exchanges, VPN, enterprise data center transport and data at rest. Determine which ones are most important to protect and understand the impact of a potential quantum-enabled attack. Prioritize Actions With the impact assessment complete, create a risk response strategy (e.g., accept, avoid, transfer, or mitigate). Then, prioritize your risk categories (critical, high, medium, low) and define risk tolerance statements for each. In these statements, articulate what actions you’ll take, in what order, who will perform them, and on what time horizon. Examine Solutions Once you’ve prioritized the actions to take to protect critical services, examine the available solutions to address them. There should be no appetite for accepting risk where there is an approved quantum-resistant solution available. Agencies should explore viable near-term solutions to counter the “harvest and replay later” threat. Long-term solutions should be based on approved NIST and/or NSA standards. Implement Implementing quantum-resistant algorithms that drive resiliency is a logical next step, once NIST has fully vetted and provided guidance. Part of the implementation process involves following the risk prioritization schedule and being clear about what solutions will be implemented in what sequence. Track to Completion Agencies should be sure to track and document their solution implementation. This will provide a roadmap for future updates when new standards are released. Monitor Continuously As with anything cybersecurity-related, agencies should continuously monitor their encryption risk. Expect standards and solutions to be updated frequently in line with quantum advancements, as well as the advancements in the sophistication of hacking techniques. To be quantum resilient across the enterprise, agencies should plan and budget for these activities now so that they can be prepared to implement new solutions as soon as the new standards are released. The goal is to conduct proactive planning that drives future security; to improve trust in data confidentiality and integrity; to lower the risk of the pending quantum threat to current encryption algorithms; and to consistently broaden awareness of quantum’s impact to cybersecurity across the enterprise.

It’s a OUR CAPABILITIES OUR CAPABILITIES Learn more about how GDIT is helping agencies understand and leverage quantum computing. CYBER disruptive technology that aims to surpass the capabilities of the most powerful supercomputers and solve problems that are considered too complicated for classical computers. This emergence of quantum as a compute resource for solving specific computing challenges is perhaps the most significant facet of quantum for federal agencies to understand. A Brief Overview In classical computing, the fundamental object of information is the bit, which can have a value of either 0 or 1. It’s the combination of bits that enable the storage of values and computers to perform operations. For example, two bits will give you four possible values (00, 01, 10, 11) with only one value being stored at a given time. Quantum computers primarily use two properties of quantum mechanics to make their calculations. The first is superposition where a quantum bit (qubit) can be in two states at the same time. Because a qubit can be in a superposition of 0 and 1, every operation is done on both values at the same time. Following the previous example, one qubit can take the value of two bits. Two qubits can take the possible values of two bits (00, 01, 10, 11) simultaneously. Quantum computers also use the entanglement property, where particles or qubits are connected and can act on one another even when they are physically apart. For example, polarized light that has two entangled photons that have horizontal and vertical polarization. A change in one photon will instantly change the other. Entanglement is a significant difference from classical computing and enables quantum computers to perform complex computations more efficiently. In that vein, quantum computers are exponentially faster than classical computers and can support more advanced and complex compute applications such as  artificial intelligence and machine learning . Quantum computing is about efficiency of solutions derived by quantum circuit configuration, more than just speed, because it’s really about the number of iterations taken to solve a complex problem than brute compute power alone. Some problems are not solvable for classical computing, such as factoring large integers into prime numbers. In 2019, at Oak Ridge National Laboratory,  NASA and Google demonstrated the ability to calculate what would take even the largest and most advanced supercomputers thousands of years. Their quantum computer did it in 200 seconds and with just 53 qubits. The quantum computing industry continues to make advances in the accessibility and development of quantum computers. In November 2021,  IBM  unveiled their 127-Qubit Quantum Processor, and customers are now able to access a variety of quantum computing hardware systems through cloud services such  Amazon Web Services (AWS) ,  Microsoft Azure , and  Google Cloud . Putting Quantum to Work Consider health care. It’s evident that cancer isn’t one disease but many, and it manifests differently in different people. Quantum computers could allow scientists to create new treatments unique to specific groups of people quickly – millions of individual cures and millions of individuals cured. Think about genetic conditions where humans have roughly 22,000 genes. The ability to test gene therapies or screen for genetic diseases on this – for a quantum computer – relatively small set of variables is powerful. Think about vaccine development, clinical trials, and more. There are also applications for quantum computers in securing communications. Quantum computers are well suited for encrypting communications and detecting if they’ve been hacked. For governments, that can mean scrambling messages between intelligence agencies, militaries, or cables between diplomats to make them exponentially more difficult to crack. For federal agencies, quantum computing can play an essential role in advancing their missions – whatever their nature – as well as in cybersecurity , particularly in next-generation cryptography. Agencies can leverage quantum computing to help test new encryption algorithms that are quantum-resistant, which is essential to get in front of a widening array of cybersecurity threats. Protecting Data from Quantum Computer Attacks There are also risks with this nascent technology. With quantum computers, adversaries and traditional hackers won’t need to penetrate networks to access sensitive information. Using a method called “harvest now, decrypt later,” hackers can intercept encrypted data during transmission and later decrypt the data using existing quantum algorithms. Federal agencies need to prepare for this pending threat and leverage quantum-resistant technologies. The White House recently issued two  presidential directives  advancing the development of quantum technologies and preparing for the risks posed by quantum computers to cybersecurity. The  National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST)  is leading an effort that uses a public, competition-like process to select one or more cryptographic algorithms as new standards for the post-quantum era. Once NIST identifies the new standards, federal agencies will need to move swiftly to implement them. GDIT is actively preparing to support federal agencies with quantum-resistant solutions and has developed a risk-based framework to support their implementation efforts. GDIT’s framework begins with working with agencies to build a quantum-resistant implementation strategy that includes assessing and analyzing the environment and prioritizing and implementing approved quantum-resistant solutions. Agencies need to have consistent security awareness by monitoring and reporting the potential quantum impact across their Information Technology (IT) enterprise. We look forward to supporting federal agencies in mitigating the pending quantum threat. We are just scratching the surface regarding what quantum computing can do to solve the world’s toughest challenges. We are excited to help federal agencies leverage the promise and potential of quantum computing and apply it with current technology to advance their mission. Investing in how to utilize the advances in quantum computing now will pay dividends in the future—exponentially larger ones, for sure.

Protecting Workloads Using Zero Trust: 5 Steps to Take Now,"According to zero trust architecture, an application workload is a tightly coupled group of resources that run and securely support an application or capability. Cybersecurity professionals must use every tool in their toolboxes to protect the network and their employees. GDIT helps customers to develop their zero trust journey.","2. Implement Micro-Segmentation and Run-Time Threat Protection Broadly, zero trust focuses on the  concept of micro-segmentation  – a virtual network security technique that enables security architects to logically divide a data center into distinct security segments – even down to the individual application workload level – and then define security controls and deliver services for each unique segment.4. Integrate Continuous Security Monitoring When it comes to security monitoring, we recommend that  customers implement continuous application security monitoring  for log management, container runtime behavior drift detection, and Kubernetes configuration change monitoring to ensure all workload elements are operating as defined by hardened configuration baselines. To fully understand the “application workload” pillar of  zero trust architecture (ZTA)  one must start by defining the term “workload.”3. Apply Application Security – Secure Design, Development, Build & Deployment of the Application During application design, we recommend focusing on security planning that considers all relevant security standards, including the Risk Management Framework and NIST 800-53 security controls.","application, security, workload, trust, software, access, datum, network, service, capability","application workload, virtual machine, security control, malicious attack, artificial intelligence, min read application service, application workload pillar, trust architecture, term workload, trust journey","APPLICATION SERVICES CYBER ZERO TRUST  By   Jay Olsen Jay Olsen Vice President, Application Services Technology","To fully understand the “application workload” pillar of  zero trust architecture (ZTA)  one must start by defining the term “workload.” OUR CAPABILITIES OUR CAPABILITIES Learn more about how GDIT helps customers begin, sustain and enhance their zero trust journey. ZERO TRUST ACCELERATOR"," To fully understand the “application workload” pillar of  zero trust architecture (ZTA)  one must start by defining the term “workload.” OUR CAPABILITIES OUR CAPABILITIES Learn more about how GDIT helps customers begin, sustain and enhance their zero trust journey. ZERO TRUST ACCELERATOR A workload is a tightly coupled group of resources that run and securely support an application or capability. This footprint of an application as it consumes computing resources in of the form of CPU, memory, I/O, and network is its “application workload.” An application’s workload encompasses CPU, memory, I/O, and network characteristics – all running through a group of virtual machines or containers that interface with network and storage infrastructures that allows the application to perform it functions or capabilities. Related, a cloud workload is an application, service, capability, or a specified amount of work that consumes cloud-based resources (such as computing or memory power). So, when we look at  securing software on a network , we must also look at securing the workload associated with it to protect the network and, by extension, the enterprise or agency itself. And it stands to reason, right? Software vulnerabilities are on the rise. From the SolarWinds and Log4j exploits to data breaches at major retailers, bad actors are using increasingly sophisticated techniques – or leveraging zero-day vulnerabilities – to do harm. It’s therefore incumbent upon cybersecurity professionals to use every tool in our toolboxes as well. Enter, zero trust for application workloads. Zero trust is a security approach that requires that all users and services, whether they are inside or outside an organization’s network, must be continuously validated to access applications. Those looking to apply zero trust to application workloads can take five important steps to do so, and to improve the overall cybersecurity posture of their organizations at the same time. 1. Implement Centralized Identity, Access Authentication and Authorization The current reality for most federal agencies is that many legacy applications are not designed to take advantage of  identity, credential and access management ( ICAM) , even if it exists in the enterprise. Legacy applications typically assume identities are based on usernames and passwords. This is a major risk in the current cybersecurity environment where attackers can use multiple techniques to obtain the usernames and passwords of admin-level access staff. We recommend implementing centralized ICAM, a framework of policies built into an organization’s information technology infrastructure that allows system owners to have assurance that the right person is accessing the right information at the right time for the right reason from any device anywhere. Next, we counsel our customers to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA), assuring the credentialed identity of the individual seeking access. MFA is typically implemented by codes sent to users via email or text SMS messaging and is supported by many common software security libraries and frameworks. Finally, it’s important to also implement role-based access control (RBAC), which is focused on least-privileged access – only authorizing access to the data and applications required for a specific need or task. 2. Implement Micro-Segmentation and Run-Time Threat Protection Broadly, zero trust focuses on the  concept of micro-segmentation  – a virtual network security technique that enables security architects to logically divide a data center into distinct security segments – even down to the individual application workload level – and then define security controls and deliver services for each unique segment. Micro-segmentation can be used to protect every virtual machine (VM) in an enterprise network with policy-driven, application-level security controls. Because security policies are applied to separate application workloads, micro-segmentation software can significantly bolster a company’s resistance to attack. We recommend that our customers implement runtime application self-protection (RASP) which is used to protect applications from malicious attacks and unexpected deviations in their behavior. RASP tools can operate within the application’s runtime environment, allowing them to get visibility inside the application to detect and block any malicious attacks or any deviations in expected behavior. 3. Apply Application Security – Secure Design, Development, Build & Deployment of the Application During application design, we recommend focusing on security planning that considers all relevant security standards, including the Risk Management Framework and NIST 800-53 security controls. Emerging security products can help automate security control identification and compliance, threat modeling, and vulnerability management. For the development, build and deployment phases, teams should apply AppSec – to include defining agency secure coding practices and oversight, establishing secure artifact repositories, and shift-left security testing as part of continuous integration and delivery. This includes using trusted libraries and automated vulnerability scanning – this encompasses static, dynamic, and interactive application security testing, software composition analysis, container scanning, and secrets management. Finally, teams looking to apply zero trust to application workloads can implement policies designed to secure the software supply chain, in line with the  2021 Cyber Executive Order . Emerging software supply chain integrity frameworks enable agencies to create software bill of materials (SBOMs); to manage the use of open source and third-party software and components more proactively and efficiently; and help to establish “provenance” of all software components and libraries. 4. Integrate Continuous Security Monitoring When it comes to security monitoring, we recommend that  customers implement continuous application security monitoring  for log management, container runtime behavior drift detection, and Kubernetes configuration change monitoring to ensure all workload elements are operating as defined by hardened configuration baselines. Cloud-native log aggregation, analysis, and auditing tools should also be incorporated, including centralized logging and telemetry that includes extract, transform, and load (ETL) capabilities to normalize log data. 5. Secure Data Access Finally, zero trust includes a data security pillar – promoting the concept of an enterprise understanding of data and its categories. This data pillar is focused on protecting data at enterprise level – not the application level. Data access security is paramount, and data should be encrypted both in transit and at rest, and each data element should be managed by its access, view, and modification controls determined by the zero trust identity. Application workloads, while sometimes overlooked, can be an essential part of an overall zero trust strategy that improves both cyber response and resilience. Amid increasing and increasingly sophisticated attacks, it’s more important than ever for organizations and agencies to protect their networks and assets at every possible juncture.

ZERO TRUST ACCELERATOR Unlike other value calculations, proving the return on investment with Zero Trust doesn’t require future casts or complex computations within agencies. A lot of that work has been done by the private sector and is well established. In fact, a Forrester study, commissioned by Microsoft in December of 2021, found that organizations save an average of $20 per employee, per month by moving to Zero Trust and eliminating redundant security solutions. Imagine that impact spread across the whole of the Federal government. It would exceed half a billion dollars every year. And that’s just one savings aspect classified in the report. Beyond cost savings, the benefits of Zero Trust for agencies are ones that can be seen in real-time, on a day-to-day basis. Here are seven examples of those benefits and how they come to fruition inside an agency. 1. Added Flexibility Millions of Americans worked from home for the majority of 2020 and 2021. Some still are doing it. The Federal government is no exception. Prior to Zero Trust, supporting this massive shift to remote working would have required independent solutioning and security protocols on a one-off basis for staff working outside the perimeter. Zero Trust assumes the same security challenges for everyone and, therefore, the same benefits. When Zero Trust becomes the security approach, agencies save time and money. Plus, enabling Zero Trust makes resources and applications available everywhere – not just on core systems – promoting application security to employees in the field while also driving productivity. A win-win. 2. Fewer Products When it comes to security products, Zero Trust drives streamlined packaging and licensing with federal agencies. It prevents agent-creep because you can scale a single agent back and instead implement it as an endpoint – meaning, for example, agencies don’t need three security environments. They can get all of it as a cloud-hosted solution and a single point of failure. In practice, Zero Trust complements security clients throughout the architecture. 3. Better Visibility In cybersecurity, and elsewhere, there’s a well-known axiom that “you don’t know what you don’t know.” Zero Trust, because it’s built on transparency and access permissions at every layer, maximizes what we do know. We know where devices and are and who’s on them and what they’re doing. That visibility is valuable and can prevent untold levels of risk. 4. Faster Data Collection In the event of a breach, Zero Trust enables cybersecurity teams to collect and use data faster, so that they can minimize the impact of a breach. In a Zero Trust model with network segmentation, one incident doesn’t take down adjacent systems and services , and teams can limit the spread of an attack and reduce both damages and costs. 5. Increased Compliance Compliance with new and evolving standards is always a challenge – as is implementing and documenting how an agency is compliant. Zero Trust builds accountability around how security procedures are working and, additionally, provides a playbook for how to respond in the event of a breach. 6. Improved Agility With Zero Trust, it’s cheaper to implement new products and applications because teams have already designed for the security architecture and infrastructure approach. In this model, experimentation and doing new things on a network is cheaper because a security plan is established and in place and teams can more quickly move on to other elements of a new implementation. 7. Greater Resiliency Finally, Zero Trust benefits agencies in that it makes them more resilient. As ransomware events become more common, more sophisticated and less expensive to execute, agencies have moved to immutable back-ups that can’t be edited or damaged. This makes incident response a faster and more trusted process when minutes matter. It’s clear that there are many benefits for agencies in moving to Zero Trust – benefits that will enable them to deliver on their missions more efficiently and more effectively at the same time.
